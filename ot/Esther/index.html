            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                The book of Esther is unique in that it does not explicitly mention the name of God, yet it powerfully depicts His providential hand at work. 
                The author of Esther is unknown, but some traditions attribute it to Mordecai, one of the main figures in the narrative. 
                The title of the book comes from its central character, Esther, a Jewish woman who becomes the queen of Persia and plays a crucial role in the deliverance of her people.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Time Written</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                The events of the book take place during the reign of King Xerxes (Ahasuerus) of Persia, around 486â€“464 B.C. 
                Scholars suggest that the book was written sometime in the late fifth or early fourth century B.C., 
                likely by a Jewish author living in Persia who had access to Persian court records and Jewish traditions.

                Esther highlights God's providence and sovereignty, even when His presence is not explicitly acknowledged. 
                The book tells the story of how God preserved His people from destruction through the courage of Esther and the wisdom of Mordecai. 
                It also explains the origins of the Jewish festival of Purim, which commemorates this divine deliverance.
