    <strong>v3 Tamar:</strong> The inclusion of five women in Jesus' genealogy—Tamar, Rahab (v. 5), 
    <a href="../../ot/Ruth/index.html" class="text-blue-500 underline">Ruth</a> (v. 5), Bathsheba ("the wife of Uriah," v. 6), and Mary (v. 16)—is unusual, 
    since descent was usually traced through men as the head of the family. Rahab and Ruth were Gentiles, and Tamar, Rahab, and Bathsheba 
    were women of questionable character. The lineage is comprised of men, women, adulterers, prostitutes, heroes, and Gentiles—and Jesus will be Savior of all.
