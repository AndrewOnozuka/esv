                Widespread evidence from the early church fathers affirms that Peter passed on reports of the words 
                and deeds of Jesus to his attendant and writer, John Mark. Of particular significance in this regard are the brief 
                statements by Papias (Bishop of Hierapolis; C.A.D. 120), preserved by Eusebius of Caesarea (260-340). Papias states that 
                he received oral tradition from John the elder and apostle, and he passes on the following regarding Mark: 
                (1) he was the writer for Peter; (2) he wrote down accurately as much as he could remember of Peter's words, 
                which the latter had adapted to the needs of the moment; (3) he was not an eyewitness of Jesus, nor a disciple 
                (but see note on Mark 14:52); and (4) it was his desire not to omit or misrepresent anything. 
                Papias concluded that the Gospel of Mark gains its apostolic and reliable character from its Petrine origin 
                (<span class="italic">Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History 2.15.1-2; 3.39.14-16</span>).
                <br><br>
                Internal evidence also supports the Patristic testimony that Peter stands behind Mark's Gospel. Mark's account 
                is especially vivid when recounting incidents involving Peter. It presents the weaknesses of Peter, as well as 
                the disciples as a whole, and omits praiseworthy or noticeable references to Peter reported in Matthew and Luke. 
                It has also been observed that there exists a certain structural proximity between Peter's Caesarea speech 
                (<span class="italic">Acts 10:34-43</span>) and the Gospel of Mark. <span class="text-sm text-gray-500">[ESVSB pg. 1889]</span>

                The external and internal data most convincingly point to Rome as the place of composition and a date for Mark in the 
                mid- to late-50s A.D. (but some scholars date it in the mid- or late-60s; see below). The argument in favor of the 
                mid- to late-50s is that the book of Acts ends with Paul in prison c. A.D. 62, leading many scholars to believe that Acts 
                was written around that time. (Others suggest that Acts does not end at the point it was written because the key point of Acts 
                is that the gospel had made it to Rome.) If Acts was written in the early 60s, then Luke's Gospel was written before Acts 
                (<span class="italic">cf. Luke 1:3 with Acts 1:1</span>), sometime in the early 60s. And if Luke depends on Mark's Gospel for much of his material and 
                overall structure (the clear majority view among scholars today), then Mark was written before Luke. This would place Mark in the 
                mid- to late-50s. <span class="text-sm text-gray-500">[ESVSB pg. 1889-1890]</span>

                The ultimate purpose and theme of Mark is to present and defend Jesus' universal call to discipleship. 
                Mark returns often to this theme, and as the narrative unfolds he categorizes his main audience as either followers or opponents of Jesus. 
                This implies that discipleship for Mark is essentially a relationship with Jesus, not merely following a certain code of conduct. 
                Fellowship with Jesus marks the heart of the disciple's life, and this fellowship includes trusting him, confessing him, 
                taking note of his conduct, following his teaching, and being shaped by a relationship to him. Discipleship also means 
                being prepared to face the kind of rejection that Jesus faced. <span class="text-sm text-gray-500">[ESVSB pg. 1891-1892]</span>
