            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Since none of the four Gospels includes the names of their authors in the original manuscripts, 
                they are all technically anonymous. This is not surprising, since the authors likely compiled their Gospel accounts 
                for members of their own churches, to whom they were already well known. However, historical documents from early church history 
                provide significant insight into the Gospels' authorship. The earliest traditions of the church are unanimous in attributing the first Gospel to Matthew, 
                the former tax collector who followed Jesus and became one of his 12 disciples. The earliest and most important of these traditions comes from the second century 
                in the writings of Papias, bishop of Hierapolis in Asia Minor (c. A.D. 135), and Irenaeus, bishop of Lyons in Gaul (c. 175). 
                Because these early church leaders had either direct or indirect contact with the apostolic community, they would have been very familiar with the Gospels' origins. 
                Moreover, no competing traditions now exist (if they ever did) attributing Matthew's Gospel to any other author. 
                If Matthew did not write the book, it is hard to see why the false ascription would bear the name of a relatively obscure apostle 
                when more well-known and popular figures could have been chosen (e.g., Philip, Thomas, or James).
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Matthean authorship is denied by some modern scholars, especially on the view that the author of Matthew borrowed 
                much of his material from Mark's Gospel. Given that Matthew was an apostle while Mark was not, it is assumed that Matthew 
                would not have needed (or chosen) to depend on Mark's material. But even if Matthew did borrow from Mark's Gospel, it would only have added 
                to Matthew's apostolic credibility since the evidence suggests that Mark himself relied extensively on the testimony of the apostle Peter.

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                When Jesus called him, Matthew was sitting in the tax collector's booth (9:9), collecting taxes for Herod Antipas, 
                and this may have been along a commercial trading route about 4 miles (6.4 km) from Capernaum. However, since the narrative surrounding Matthew's call 
                is set in Capernaum (9:1, 7, 10; cf. 4:13), the tax booth may have been on the Sea of Galilee at Capernaum, since Herod also taxed fishermen. 
                At his calling in the first Gospel he is referred to as "Matthew" (9:9), while Mark's and Luke's Gospels describe him as "Levi the son of Alphaeus" (Mark 2:14) and "Levi" (Luke 5:27). 
                The reason for the variation in names has elicited much discussion, but most scholars believe that the tax collector had two names, Matthew Levi, which he either possessed from birth 
                or took on following his conversion. His occupation as a tax collector implies that he had training in scribal techniques and was thus able to write, 
                while his identity as a Galilean Jewish Christian suggests his ability to interpret the words and actions of Jesus in light of OT messianic expectations.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Time Written: late 50s to early 60s A.D.</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                The precise date of the writing of Matthew's Gospel is not known. 
                Some scholars argue for a date later than the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, 
                since Jesus alludes to this event in 24:1-28. 
                Of course, such a conclusion is warranted only if one denies Jesus' ability to predict the future. 
                In light of Irenaeus's assertion (c. A.D. 175) that Matthew composed his Gospel while Peter and Paul 
                were still living (Irenaeus, Against Heresies 3.1.1), it is traditionally dated to the late 50s or early 60s.

                This is the story of Jesus of Nazareth, recorded by the apostle Matthew 
                as a compelling witness that Jesus is the long-anticipated Messiah, 
                who brought the kingdom of God to earth and is the prophesied fulfillment 
                of God’s promise of true peace and deliverance for both Jew and Gentile.

                        Bathsheba ("the wife of Uriah," v. 6), and Mary (v. 16)—is unusual, since descent was usually traced through men as the head of the family. 
                        Rahab and Ruth were Gentiles, and Tamar, Rahab, and Bathsheba were women of questionable character.
