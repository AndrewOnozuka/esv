# Esther 1:5-22

## Sermon Information
- **Date:** May 1, 2022
- **Church:** Kairos Christian Church
- **Speaker:** Pastor Peter Yoon
- **Title:** Queen Vashti's Dignity

## Historical Context
- The Book of Esther takes place during the reign of King Xerxes (Ahasuerus), the fourth king of the Persian Empire.
- Xerxes ruled over a vast empire stretching from India to Kush (modern-day Ethiopia).
- The events occur around 460 BC, during a time of Persian expansion and conflicts with Greece.
- The Book of Esther is unique in that it does not explicitly mention God but showcases His sovereignty through events.

## Summary of Chapter 1
- King Xerxes holds a lavish six-month-long banquet for his nobles and military leaders to solidify their loyalty.
- Following this, he hosts a seven-day banquet for all people in Susa.
- Queen Vashti holds a separate banquet for the women.
- On the seventh day, Xerxes, in a drunken state, commands Vashti to appear before his guests wearing her royal crown to showcase her beauty.
- Queen Vashti refuses, an act that defies the king’s authority and cultural expectations.
- The king, angered by her defiance, consults his advisors, who fear that Vashti’s actions will set a precedent for disobedience among all women in the empire.
- A decree is issued that Vashti be removed as queen and that all wives should respect their husbands.
- The decree, ironically, ensures that Vashti’s actions become widely known, rather than kept quiet.

## Key Themes & Lessons
1. **Dignity & Integrity**
   - Queen Vashti’s refusal highlights the importance of personal dignity.
   - She chooses to preserve her honor rather than submit to the king’s degrading request.

2. **Irony & Divine Sovereignty**
   - The king’s decree, meant to suppress disobedience, inadvertently publicizes Vashti’s defiance.
   - This sets the stage for Esther’s rise, demonstrating God’s unseen hand in orchestrating events.

3. **Foolish Leadership & Rash Decisions**
   - Xerxes’ impulsive, drunken decision-making leads to unnecessary consequences.
   - His advisors act out of fear rather than wisdom, enforcing a decree that lacks true justice.

4. **Women’s Role in Society**
   - Vashti’s actions challenge cultural norms regarding women’s submission and obedience.
   - This sets up Esther’s future role in using her position wisely for the sake of her people.

## Connection to Modern Life
- Even when God seems absent, He is working behind the scenes.
- Integrity and dignity should not be compromised for the sake of power or approval.
- Leadership requires wisdom and patience rather than reacting in anger or fear.
- Cultural norms and laws may not always align with justice, but faith and courage can lead to change.

## Looking Ahead
- With Vashti removed, the stage is set for Esther’s introduction in chapter 2.
- The king’s search for a new queen will lead to Esther stepping into a pivotal role in history.
