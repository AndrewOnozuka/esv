# Esther 8

## Sermon Information
- **Date:** June 19, 2022
- **Church:** Kairos Christian Church
- **Speaker:** Pastor Phillip Chen
- **Title:** An Edict of Salvation

## Historical Context
- Esther 8 follows the execution of Haman and the great reversal of his schemes.
- The Persian law could not be revoked, meaning that the edict calling for the destruction of the Jews was still in effect (Esther 3:13).
- Esther and Mordecai must now find a way to counteract this decree and protect the Jewish people.
- The narrative shifts from survival to salvation, where the Jews are given the authority to defend themselves.
- The chapter presents a profound spiritual parallel—humanity was under the first edict of sin and death, but through Christ, we have received the second edict of salvation (Romans 6:23, Ephesians 2:1-5).

## Summary of Chapter 8
- King Xerxes gives Queen Esther Haman’s estate, signifying his complete downfall (Esther 8:1).
- Mordecai is presented with the king’s signet ring, taking the position of power that Haman once held (Esther 8:2).
- Esther pleads with the king to revoke Haman’s decree, but since Persian law cannot be reversed, a counter-edict must be issued (Esther 8:3-8).
- Mordecai writes a new decree allowing the Jews to assemble and defend themselves against any attack (Esther 8:9-12).
- The decree is spread quickly throughout the empire, bringing hope and relief to the Jewish people (Esther 8:13-14).
- The Jews rejoice at the news, and many people of other nationalities align themselves with them out of fear (Esther 8:15-17).

## Key Themes & Lessons

1. **The Two Edicts: Death & Salvation**
   - The first edict decreed destruction, but the second brought salvation.
   - This mirrors the Gospel—we were under the edict of sin and death (Romans 3:23), but Christ issued a new decree of salvation through His sacrifice (Romans 8:1-2).
   - Ephesians 2:1-5 describes how we were dead in sin (first edict) but made alive in Christ (second edict).

2. **The Great Reversal**
   - Haman’s wealth, power, and authority are transferred to Mordecai and Esther (Esther 8:1-2).
   - What was intended for destruction becomes a moment of salvation (Genesis 50:20).
   - The wicked may seem to prosper for a time, but their downfall is inevitable (Psalm 37:7-9).

3. **The Power of Advocacy**
   - Esther courageously intercedes on behalf of her people, demonstrating the importance of speaking up for justice (Proverbs 31:8-9).
   - Her persistence shows the necessity of standing firm in faith and seeking change (Luke 18:1-8).
   - Advocacy requires action—prayer and bold steps go hand in hand.

4. **Spreading the Good News**
   - The second edict was sent out swiftly on the fastest horses (Esther 8:13-14).
   - This reflects the Great Commission, where believers are called to share the Gospel urgently (Matthew 28:19-20).
   - The news of salvation led many to align themselves with God’s people (Esther 8:17), showing how God’s work extends beyond His chosen people.

5. **Cause for Celebration**
   - The first edict left the city of Susa in confusion, but the second brought joy and celebration (Esther 8:15-17).
   - Salvation should bring joy—Psalm 149 calls us to rejoice, praise, and dance in response to God’s deliverance.
   - Many believers live without fully embracing the joy of salvation; we are called to worship with gratitude and freedom (Philippians 4:4).

## Connection to Modern Life
- The world may seem unjust, but God is always at work bringing about divine reversals.
- We are called to advocate for righteousness, using our influence for justice and mercy.
- Just as the second edict brought hope, the Gospel brings the ultimate hope of salvation.
- Sharing the message of salvation should be done with urgency and joy.
- Are we living as people who have received the second edict, or are we still acting as if we are under the first?

## Discussion Questions
- Why doesn’t the second edict make sense without the first edict? How does this parallel our salvation story?
- How much weight do we give to the power, wealth, and positions of this world compared to the eternal edict of salvation?
- What is keeping us from expressing full joy in our worship and gratitude for salvation?
- How can we actively share the second edict of salvation with those around us?

## Looking Ahead
- The Jews must still prepare to defend themselves as the day of conflict approaches.
- The ultimate victory of God’s people will unfold in the next chapter.

Esther 8 highlights the power of divine reversals, the importance of advocacy, and the urgent call to share the good news of salvation. As believers, we live under the new edict of grace and are called to proclaim it boldly. We are not just recipients of salvation but couriers of the good news, carrying it to the ends of the earth with urgency and joy.
