good morning um thanks for leading us in a time of intercession for uh the communion in yaldi and um before we get to the sermon um I just want to take another moment um you know last last year if you were with us we we went through a series on the Psalms of lament and how lament is a healthy way of responding to um just tragedy and frustration and anger and and things like that and you know as we think about all the the shootings that have taken place um that have been highlighted by the media but you know the many more that didn't make it to the media um our hearts are grieved and I think one of the appropriate responses is um lament um a time of lament and you know the Temptation is to kind of just gloss over it because the news cycle kind of comes so quickly um but yeah if we could take some time this moment I'll give us like a minute um today is also Memorial Day weekend and as we think about Memorial Day sometimes we're confli icted because it's in a sense one day that or one a weekend where we honor those who have laid down their lives out of love but the same time we also remember those who are grieving uh those that have Lo lost loved ones and I can't just I can't help but remember that in the Grand Story Of God um God's intention was that death would be unnatural it's not natural for death to take place and yet in this um kind of weekend where um we just think about so many many people who have lost loved ones um and currently even ongoing like the U the war in Ukraine and um even the the in Afghanistan like these things that have happened fairly recently um it's just so difficult so um I want to encourage you to just take a minute as we um just pray to the Lord um let's pray some breath prayers um if you were with us in this prayer series that we went through one of the ways that we can pray is breath prayers which are basically like prayers that you can pray Within a breath right and um you know these days I find myself just praying a lot of breath prayers like Lord have mercy on us um there's um one line in Revelation that I've been praying a lot where it says the spirit and bride say say maratha come Lord Jesus come and so I would say come Lord Jesus come quickly um to our broken world so let's take a minute and let's just um pray some breath prayers as um as we we mourn with those who have uh lost loved ones in this place okay let's pray for father we mourn with those who mourn and we grieve with those who grieve and we ask that you would protect us from hardened hearts protect us from despair from fear from callousness Lord have mercy on us and Lord we join with all the angels all the saints and we say the spirit and the bride say come Lord Jesus come come quickly restore us from our Brokenness we pray in Jesus name amen uh one more thing before the sermon um before we get to the sermon um I just want to share my gratitude um to all of you um on behalf of my family um Pastor Peter shared a few weeks ago my mother-in-law finished her battle with cancer and went on to be with the Lord on Mother's Day of all days and um you know it's it's it's been it's been a journey and um I think there's a lot of feelings that we are feeling I know a lot of you have asked um how how we're feeling and how we're doing and amidst all of the feelings I think one thing uh is we're grateful we're we're thankful for so many of you that reached out and prayed for us and cared for us sent us meal and encouraged us along the way so so thank you for that and um we're just truly grateful for this church family um with that said um let's jump into the sermon uh this morning we if you're new or if you're visiting we are in the Book of Esther and we are in the fifth chapter of this book uh Esther chapter 5 and whenever we go through a particular book um especially if it's follows a narrative um I like to kind of give a quick re recap of where we're at I know that some of you may be here for the first time or you haven't been with us every single week and so let me just give a quick recap but let me also encourage you um if you missed a sermon and you know you want to learn more about this book of Esther I I want to encourage you to go back and listen to those sermons uh because it does give you a greater comprehension of the book as well as the Practical applications that we can take from the word of God right not something that we are just looking at but something that applies directly to our lives so here's a quick recap on the Book of Esther so far we started out the Book of Esther with the banishing of Queen vashi right King Xerxes uh he's the king of the Persian Empire and he's throwing this huge banquet um in order to shore up his military Alliance so that in three years time he can wage war against Greece and so he's throwing this long banquet it's like a weekl long kind of banquet and at the height of the drunkenness of this banquet uh he orders for Queen vashi to come supposedly wearing this crown of dignity but actually what he's doing he's ordering her to come naked completely stripped of her dignity and obviously um you know or you know of course Queen vashi she refuses and so King xerses and his advisers after you know the ban has died down uh they they come up with this plan to make an example out of the queen um and they say let's banish her from the presence of the king and so Queen vashi is banished um they make an example out of her and actually when King X's um anger has subsided it says he regretted that decision now fast forward a few years he's come back from his military campaign uh in Greece and it's a failed military campaign and and then after some time his advisers come up with his plan to replace Queen vashi they say let's throw a beauty pageant and all of the empire of Persia will come and and and whoever is chosen will become the new Queen and so we're introduced to Esther right she is the she is a Jew but she's told to protect her identity to not tell anyone about it and so as she comes she ends up winning the whole thing and she becomes the queen of Persia then in Esther chapter 3 we are introduced to hmon who is an agagite uh as well as Mori the Jew and we see this conflict starting to brew between the two but what we find out is that there's actually a larger conflict that they are descendants of people groups that have been Waring with one another uh centuries ago and even grander um if we kind of take a step even further back we see this Cosmic battle this Cosmic conflict that is happening uh that that that FS this kind of interpersonal conflict between hmon and morai and so in in hmon um in Esther chapter 3 hmon devises this demonic plan to annihilate all the Jews in the in the Persian Empire and King xeres actually signs off on it and so there's this plan that's in motion that's going to allow for the annihilation of the Jewish people and last week we we read that morai goes to Queen Esther she's kind of insulated from all this news a little bit oblivious but morai tells her of this and appeals to her for her to go into the presence of the king to plead for her people now you know there's kind of some back and forth But ultimately we see that Esther agrees and she's getting ready to go into the queen uh to the king and so here we pick up the story from last week where Esther has asked uh the the people to fast and pray for her and she herself has fasted for three days and it says on the third day Esther put on her royal robes and she makes her way to the inner Court of the palace where the king is sitting on his throne okay sounds kind of um innocent right but just imagine with me for a moment Esther is going into the presence of the king without being summoned now we learned last week this is a an offense that is punishable by death you were not allowed to go into the presence of the the king unless you were summoned and so Esther is making this decision I'm still going to go before the king even though I'm not summoned and that offense is punishable by death in fact there are guards in the king's court who would strike you down if the king showed displeasure towards you so Esther's life is literally on the line I mean imagine if you were Esther how would you be feeling as you're walking down the long Corridor um getting ready to present yourself to the to the King right heart must be racing all kinds of thoughts going through her mind like I wonder if the king's in a good mood or not I wonder if the king got a good night's sleep and on top of that we learned last week that Esther hasn't been called into the king's presence for over 30 days now if it was just a few days right it would be kind of different situation where they've seen each other a few days ago but 30 days has passed since the last time the queen has seen the king and that's a long time I mean if you've ever wondered what someone thought about you and you know 30 days of not seeing each other kind of put a lot of thoughts in your mind right there's a lot of room for assumptions to be made a lot of room for false narratives to be conjured up a lot of room for mind reading I wonder if the king is no longer pleased with me or I wonder if the king uh you know if I did something to offend the king I wonder why I haven't seen him for over 30 days all these thoughts racing through her mind as she's walking down towards the king's presence but she's committed to going right she has committed that she will stand before the king to make an appeal for her people and as she's walking towards the king's Hall if I could just borrow the famous words of the rapper Eminem to describe Esther's feelings her palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy there's vomit on her sweater already mom spaghetti you guys know that song and I I don't know if all of that is happening but I know that she's nervous right she's nervous as she's walking towards the king's Hall and as she finally arrives she's standing before the king and imagine the king is looking at her and the guards are looking at the king what what is the king going to do see if the King was pleased and is willing to in a sense pardon this offense he would reach out his scepter towards the person who's coming so the guards are looking at the king what is he going to do and I can almost imagine the the King cracks a smile and extends his golden scepter and Esther goes and approaches the throne and so we see in verse three The King The King asked uh the the the the king uh the king asked what is it Queen Esther what is your request even up to half the kingdom it will be given you okay what is it that you're asking even up to half the kingdom it will be given you now this is not an actual promise it's more of a term of endearment uh that that actually if you remember in the New Testament story where John the baptizer is beheaded Herod actually says this to herodias his daughter right he says whatever you want up to half the kingdom I will give to you it's a term of endear dearment it's a saying that expresses the pleasure of the king uh towards the one he is speaking to and so you know when we're in this situation let's pause and think about it from the angle of the King right the king knows that this offense is punishable by death right that someone is not allowed to stand in his presence without being summoned so he knows that Queen Esther is willing to risk her life for something that she is about to request right there's something that she needs or something that she wants so much that she's willing to risk it all to lay her life on the line and so he's curious what is it that you want Queen Esther now on the other hand if we could have a peak into Queen Esther's mind we see what a relief right the King has extended his scepter towards her her life is no longer on the line and that's already a huge relief but not only that he actually expresses his pleasure towards her and says what is it that you want whatever it is I will give it to you and so this seems like the perfect time for Esther to say this is what I want but that's actually not what happens let's read on in verse four Esther replies if it pleases the king let the king together with hmon come to today for a banquet I have prepared for him so Esther's request is that the king and hmon would come to the Herm to participate in a banquet that she has prepared for them and in this request we're going to start to see this contrast between hmon and Esther and if you're following on with this series in Esther the first few chapters is actually more like character development right it's kind of showing us a peak into who these characters are what they're like um how these characters are beginning to develop and then in last chapter in this and kind of going forward forward the plot is starting to thicken the plot is starting to develop we start to see one of the protagonists Esther the Jew and one of the antagonists hmon the agagite coming together and interacting with one another and in this chapter we start seeing this interaction and I think what the author wants us to notice is the DraStic difference between the two this almost comical difference between what can only be described as the wise and the foolish so this morning we're going to take a look at Queen Esther first and then we're going to take a look at hmon and we're going to see how Esther and her words and actions are actually portrayed as wisdom and then we're going to look at hmon and how his words and actions are portrayed as foolishness so let's focus on Esther first kind of coming back into the story you know it's a little puzzling why Esther asks um for this for them to come to this banquet right why doesn't she just present the request especially now that her life is safe it seems like the king is pleased with her so why not just present the request there and then Esther doesn't present her true request instead she invites the king to a banquet and while we don't have a window into the intent of what Esther is doing why she is doing this I think one thing we can draw out is the patience that Esther shows in this whole episode the wisdom behind that patience you know one commentary that I was reading actually points to the fact that Esther strategically brings the conversation back to her place rather than having that difficult conversation in the king's court and that makes a lot of sense doesn't it right the odds are not in her favor she needs what we call homec court advantage right because the NBA playoffs are currently happening I decided to do some research and according to Bleacher Report uh in playoffs uh since 1984 I think the home team has won 65% of the games okay and and so homec court advantage you know you could debate whether it's real thing or not but we see Esther kind of bringing this back into her home court where she can dictate the environment where she can di dictate the conversation and the atmosphere uh and so we see this happening right as the story continues the king quickly summons hmon and they go to this banquet that Esther has prepared now there's something important about Banquets uh in the Book of Esther there's a lot of Banquets that are happening again in the first chapter we see immediately the opening setting is a banquet that's being thrown by King xerses to shore up this military Alliance right he wants to fight Greece because his father had failed in the campaign and so he's coming he wants to gather everyone to go again against Greece to defeat them once and for all and so he he throws these Banquets but what we also find out in um in Esther chapter 2 if you remember that sermon Pastor Peter was mentioning that even after the failed military campaign when King xeri came back all of a sudden it says the writings of a Greek historian comments that after this military defeat the king's Delight becomes one of sensual overindulgence and so you can clearly see the king uh has kind of this inward Focus this wanting to um you know pleasure himself and and so he throws a lot of these Banquets and he's has a great liking to these Banquets and I think Esther would have known that I think Esther would have used that to her advantage and so she's inviting the king to this banquet um so that they can eat and drink to his heart's content now as we go on in verse 6 it says as they were drinking wine the King again asked Esther now what is your petition it will be given you and what is your request even up to half the kingdom it will be granted so again the king knows that the banquet is not the real request right there is a reason that Esther has risked her life to stand before the king and once again the king offers Esther what she wants and surely this would be the right time to present the request but Esther once again pauses and replies with this my petition and my request is this if the king regards me with favor and it pleases the king to Grant my petition and fulfill my request let the king and hmon come tomorrow to the banquet I will prepare for them and then I will answer the king's question now I'm not sure why Esther waited until after two Banquets in order to present her real request right why can't you just present it after this one banquet but nevertheless what I think we can glean from this interaction is that she's patient she is observant she's prudent and prudent is a word that I want to Define and and use because there's actually a lot of Proverbs that talk about The Prudent versus the foolish and so to be prudent therefore is to act with or show care and thought for the future it's kind of like a careful consideration a thoughtful caution as you think about the future you're very careful in how you speak or how you act so that's Prudence here are a few here here are a few of the Proverbs that compares the wise and the foolish and the focus is on Prudence right good judgment wins favor but the way of the Unfaithful leads to their destruction Prudence is a Fountain of Life To The Prudent but Folly brings punishment to fools the wisdom of The Prudent is to give thought to their ways but the Folly of fools is deception now to to kind of push my point a little a little bit more you know it's Esther's speech I think that shows a lot of prudence the way that Esther conducts herself uh the way that she speaks it's poised it's Discerning it's sprinkled with wisdom there's a lot of thoughtful caution and consideration in what she says and presents to the king and as the S Story Goes On we're actually going to begin to see that the more Esther speaks the more favor she gains but the the more hmon speaks the the the less favor he gets the more favor he loses in the process as I was thinking about the Power of Words and speech I was reminded of how in the Book of James we are told that just as a sh a large ship is controlled by a small Rudder so the course of our life is a lot of times dictated by our tongue this small instrument in our body that can do so much good and so much damage so a quick side application point for us this morning as we think about the power of speech of words how can we be prudent in the way we talk with one another with Winsome and wholesome conviction it's funny this past Tuesday at our staff meeting we we actually talked about uh this we were doing a Bible study in the book of Acts and um you know we talked about how do we speak truth in love to speak with conviction but also have this compassion and I know know in this day and age it's so difficult to be prudent in our society especially with a lot of complex conversations that are heavily nuanced and yet how do we be people that are wise with our words prudent in our speech about a month ago this article came out by Jonathan hate a an American psychologist and the article was titled why the past 10 years of American life has been uniquely stupid it's actually a really interesting read it's long but it's interesting inter in but one of the premise of this article was how social media has had such a profound effect and impact on the toxic environment we see that exists in a lot of these hot button topics in our society right online discourse is so often heated it's uncivilized it's there's a lot of polarization and anger that's happening and I wish I could share more from this article but because of time I'm just going to focus on one point that the author makes he points out that when Facebook introduced the like and share button and the algorithm that Shar our Newsfeed it completely changed the game research shows that posts that trigger emotions especially anger at outgroups or groups that you don't belong to U are the most likely to be shared and so when your post is liked and shared and when it goes viral like I've never had a post become viral and you know you know but I imagine some of you may have but you know imagine if you get like thousands of likes and thousands of shares it actually gives you a dopamine hit and you want to post more of the post that can get you those likes and those shares so essentially on social media it actually rewards those who put up posts that encourage anger and divisiveness one of the engineers at Twitter who had worked on the retweet button later revealed that he regretted his contribution because it made Twitter a nastier place as he watched Twitter mobs forming through the use of the new tool he thought to himself we might have just handed a four-year-old a loaded weapon so all that to say this is um I think this kind of reinforces idea of how powerful words and speech really are if they have the power to bring life or death what does it look like in our day and age to be prudent with our words in our speech in the conversations that we have with one another what does it look like to have wisdom to know when to speak and when not to speak to know what to say or what not to say and I'm not just talking about the macro topics right the conversations that you know dominate um the web or or our conversation but even in our relationships with one another like I want to be prudent in the way I speak with my wife I want to be wise in the words that I speak to my children to my friends my co-workers I want to be prudent in my speech so what does it look like for us to give extra thought and care to our words and not be so quick and callous with them will we choose to be wise or will we choose to be foolish in what we say so that's Esther and moving on in this chapter we we look at hmon right hmon is elated because he's invited to not only one but two special Banquets with the king and the Queen and so he goes out in between this banquet we see that he goes out he's happy and he's in High Spirits but we see in verse 9 it says he sees morai at the king's gate and morai doesn't stand up he doesn't rise to greet hmon he doesn't show any fear in his presence and so uh so hmon is once again filled with rage against morai it says he restrains himself and goes home but hmon is incense with anger because of morai right he goes from elated to instantaneously infuriated in just one second now when we look at hmon there are two spiritual realities I want to point out uh for this section first is the the presence of the spiritual realm uh the the the spiritual battle that rages on if you weren't with us two weeks ago in Esther chapter 3 we talked about hmon the agagite he is a descendant of AAG the king of amalekites and Mori is a Jew uh you know a descendant of Saul actually King Saul and these were Arch enemies right the malachit were Arch enemies uh to the Israelites and we see that there is more that feels as rage than just a personal dislike for one another but again when we think about the meta uh Narrative of scripture this big story of God there is a cosmic battle that is happening right if you take the the story of God you see that the enemy of God is trying to Stamp Out the the line of the Messiah right the enemy of God is trying to destroy the people of God and it's through these kind of people groups that we are seeing it happen but there's this meta Narrative of how there's this Cosmic conflict that is happening and sometimes we're so unaware to the spiritual realm we don't even really give it a second thought but what we know is that there is a spiritual war that's happening that actually fuels the rage that hmon has towards uh morai now we already know about this demonically devised plan to wipe out all of the Jews but more than that hmon is trying to devise this demonic plan to uh to to destroy u morai u himself and we get glimpses of that demonization when we look at the rage that follows him okay um you know I would call this a demonic rage now you know I a demonic rage is not necessarily kind of this like IDE where you are just like demon possessed and you you don't have any valtion but I would say that this raging side of him is demonic because it is Amplified by the enemy the anger that's already inside of him is Amplified by the enemy so if there is a spiritual realm if there truly is a spiritual realm and if there is a spiritual battle that's happening angels and demons that are Waring and if it bleeds into the natural realm I think it's fair to say that Hon's anger is influenced by a demonic rage now the takeaway here is not for you to go to your friends and whenever they're angry to say oh you have a demonic rage inside of you right that's not the point what I'm trying to do is just help us become aware of this spiritual battle that is taking place that we don't often give a second thought too so have you noticed spiritual attacks like that in your life where it's less so something that's done to you but something that's Amplified inside of you that the enemy can take what's already bred Brewing inside of you and amplify it to cause harm maybe everything is neutral and you're driving and you know all of a sudden you get cut off and your anger goes from zero to 100 in a split second right you start tailgating the person you honk your horn and then last second you know if you have to like exit you swing by next to them and shoot them a dirty look right obviously I've never done that before so um you know just kidding I I have in my youth but um I'm definitely much better keeping my cool in those moments especially when I have accountability like my wife will whenever something happens she'll be like don't look when I kind of just drive by and I'm like I have to not look but you know there's something that's already Brewing inside of us that the enemy can just amplify in in a second's notice and we can just go from zero to 100 or maybe you've had a stressful day at work or at school and you come home exhausted your child or your spouse or your roommate says something and it just sets you off right it might be a small thing but because you're so frust frustrated or angry already it just sets you off and you become so upset and I I guess the point I'm trying to make is a lot of times spiritual warfare is not Satan doing something to you but amplifying something that's already inside of you he can amplify the anger that's already inside of you he can amplify the frustration and stress that's already within us and cause us to Cloud our judgment and make decisions poor decisions that will hurt people around us he can amplify the greed that's already inside of us that causes us to become Workaholics or just very stingy with our money he can amplify the fear that's already inside of us and cause us to seize control on every aspect of our life he can amplify the lust of the eyes the pride of the flesh the unforgiveness in our heart that sets us Ablaze in Rage he can amplify even the insecurities that we have the fear of man and cause it to to wreak havoc not only in our lives but in those that we love around us once again this is why we need to gear up to be prepared to fight the spiritual battle that is before us because the enemy is sneaky again he doesn't have to do something to you he can just amplify what's already inside of you so how do we gear up for the spiritual battle one by put putting on the full armor of God as described in Ephesians um by equipping ourselves with the word of God so that we are able to combat the lies of the enemy with Truth by regular regularly asking for forgiveness and forgiving those around us by prayer and fasting growing in intimacy with the Lord and becoming more and more dependent on him as a source of our strength and you know when I say all of these things I know that there are some of you or many of you that feel like you're so fatigued you're so worn out that you can't even put up your defense systems and I get it I totally understand because I've gone through that fairly recently if I'm honest I have those thought thoughts from time to time where I'm just too tired to even put up a fight but the Lord is gracious you know these past few months I I I I've felt really drained and tired and and I just feel God giving these gentle reminders not in a condemning way but he would say get up and fight get up and fight stand up and fight and I would reply Lord I'm tired I'm burnt out I'm fatigued and he would say my grace is sufficient for you get up and fight you know I'm blessed to have prayer warriors in my mom and my mother-in-law who would cover our family in prayer daily my wife would tell me that her mom is the type of mom that every day dropping them off at school she would pray over them and cover them in prayer and pray that they would be equipped with the armor of God my my mother-in-law was an intercessor and you know when she passed one of the first thoughts that went through my mind was I need more intercessors I need a strength in my prayer muscles and you know in a strange way it's like this reminder because you know I know I'm not a kid anymore but sometimes when we're with our parents we kind of revert to being a kid again right like some of you students when you go home you're going to stop doing your own laundry and cooking food and you're going to just become a kid again right and I think in a spiritual sense like when I had this like um this assurance that there are people praying over me I kind of just felt like safe and like okay like you know I can rest in this but it was another reminder when my mother-in-law passed like like I just feel like God was saying get up and fight you need to contend for yourself for your marriage for your kids for your ministry for those that um have been entrusted into your care and so again I think God at times he comes to us and not in a condemning way but he encourages us says look at the spiritual battle that is happening get up and fight I know you're weary I know you're are tired but strengthen your weary arms and your legs get up and fight you know for those of you that are part of our intercessory prayer team um I was thinking about you guys this week and I I know that you know at times prayer teams can be overlooked right they're kind of in the background but I hope you know your prayers are so important especially for caring for and praying for those who are weak and vulnerable and those who are are feeling too tired to defend themselves and my encouragement to you is continue press in and pray for those that are weak feeling weird weary and tired for all of us let's remember the spiritual battle that is before us let's turn to God and even when we're feeling tired and weary let's ask him to strengthen us so that we can resist the enemy so that we can stand up and fight against the the the the the war that the enemy is bringing to our doorstep so that's the first spiritual reality as we look at hmon this spiritual battle that has a direct impact on us and and the the second thing I want to point out is just how easy it is for joy to be taken away from hmon so let's look at verse 10 as we read on it says hmon is back home now and he called together his friends and Zares his wife and hmon boasted to them about his vast wealth his many sons and all the ways the king had honored him and how he had elevated him above the other Nobles and officials and that's not all hmon added I'm the only person Queen Esther invited to accompany the king to the banquet she gave and she has invited me along with the King tomorrow but all this gives me no satisfaction as long as I see that Jew morai sitting at the king's gate his wife zes and all his friends said to him have a pole set up reaching to a height of 50 cubits and ask the king in the morning to have Mori impaled on it then go with the King to the banquet and enjoy yourself and this suggestion delighted hmon and he had the pole set up so hmon goes and he's explaining to his wife and his friends what's happened happing and when you look at heon's life you see the wild success he has in his life right we are told that he has a wife and many sons right that is a blessing a huge blessing in that day and age he he has a lot of wealth we are told about the ways he's honored by the king in such a way that he commands the presence of the king and queen alone in a special banquet that they have chosen to throne he is so blessed and he is has so many reason uh for Joy so much favor has been shown to him and yet we see in verse 13 He says all of this gives me no satisfaction as long as I see that Jew morai sitting at the king's gate it's a little bit comical isn't it how exaggerated H Hon's anger is the fact that morai would not stand to recognize him is what sucks out all the Joy from hmon it's funny but at times it's also relatable isn't it we can wake up feeling so blessed but one snide common can ruin our entire day one act of disrespect can suck the joy out of our whole our whole day and yet the author is portraying the very lens of folly that we are to look at hmon with right we might say this is relatable but author is really pointing at hon and saying look at this Folly look at this foolishness let's look at a few more Proverbs uh that once again contrast The Prudent from the foolish says fools show show their annoyance at once but The Prudent over everything has been going wrong for Mori and the Jews and on the flip side everything has been going right for hmon right hmon has been promoted again and again to this point where he's basically like the king's right-hand man so to speak and so uh we see from this story this is the apex of the story where something is about to shift like for for those of us that are removed from the story it's almost like you can sense something is about to happen this is the point of the story where the Great great reversal is about to happen where everything seems to be going right for the wicked and everything seems to be going wrong for the righteous but at the snap of a finger things are about to change you know in our world sometimes it does seem like the wicked Prevail doesn't it sometimes it seems like those who cheat to get ahead are successful the dishonorable ones the ones that are wicked um the ones that wreak havoc seems to be the ones that are rewarded and then we see the right ious suffering we see the innocent taken advantage of and then we come to God and we say why is this happening how can this be fair I don't know if you've had those thoughts cross your mind but I've certainly had a lot of those thoughts going in on in my mind in recent days and you know I know kind of what to say and how to think but those thoughts just come like when I think about my mother-in-law who who battled this very um devastating disease I think God how could you let such a faithful servant who served you so Faithfully go through this horrible disease you know I happen to stumble upon this Psalm in my quiet time this week Psalm 37 I thought it was the perfect Psalm for what we're reading in this chapter so I'm not going to read the whole chapter but just listen to these words um this is a Psalm of David uh I'll read the verses for us he sayso not fret because of those who are evil or be envious of those who do wrong for like the grass they will soon wither like green plants they will soon die away trust in the Lord and do good dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture take Delight in the Lord and He will give you the desires of your heart commit your way to the Lord trust in him and he will do this he will make your righteous reward shine like the dawn your Vindication like the Noonday Sun be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him do not fret when people succeed in their ways when they carry out their wicked schemes refrain from anger and turn from Wrath do not fret it leads only to evil for those who are evil will be destroyed but those who hope in the Lord will inherit the land a little while and the wicked will be no more though you look for them they will not be found but the meek will inherit the land and enjoy peace and prosperity the wicked plot against the righteous and Nash their tee teeth at them but the Lord laughs at the wicked for he knows their day is coming the wicked draw the sword and bend the bow to bring down the poor and needy to slay those whose way are upright but their swords will pierce their own hearts and their bows will be broken better the little that the righteous have than the wealth of many Wicked for the power of the wicked will be broken but the Lord upholds the righteous the blameless spend their days under the Lord's care and their inheritance will endure forever in times of disaster they will not Wither in days of famine they will enjoy plenty but the Wicked Will perish though the Lord's enemies are like the flowers of the field they will be consumed assumed they will go up in smoke you know even though we can affirm this in a general sense we know there are cases when this doesn't hold true right this Psalm it doesn't make sense if our Paradigm is confined to what happens in this lifetime this only makes sense if we have a paradigm that goes beyond our life that's larger than our life on this Earth because the reality is there will be some cases where the wicked will go through life relatively unscathed and there are cases where it will seem like the righteous and the innocent are crushed but in the Paradigm of Eternity we can say with confidence the blameless spend their days under the Lord's care and their inheritance will endure forever in times of disaster they will not Wither in days of famine they will enjoy plenty and we can say Amen to that if we are under this Paradigm of Eternity it's with that that encourages us that as Paul says to the church in galatia sayso not become weary in doing good for at the proper time you will reap a harvest if we do not give up so worship theme as you come up as we wrap up let me just bring this all together you know this morning we looked at Esther right we looked at her wisdom and her Prudence her patience and thoughtful care in what she said to the King and then we looked at hmon and his folly his impatience his rash decisions that stem from his dissatisfaction and in a way we see the caricature of wisdom and of folly so in a way there's cause for us to reflect on our own lives are we acting wisely or are we acting foolishly are we speaking with Prudence or are we speaking with Folly but in the grand context of the story and the ongoing motif of the Book of Esther what we see is even though God is unmentioned we see the Fingerprints of God clearly in this story The Divine favor that places Esther where she needs to be for such a time as this and the impending doom that is coming for hon we see that even though God is unmentioned he's present his fingerprints are part of the story and I think that's an accurate representation of how we are to approach life in this world where our speech and our conduct actually matters it has an impact on the outcome but at the same time there's a mystery of God there's something that is happening in the spiritual realm that we may not necessarily be aware of that is is also happening and has an impact on the income on the outcome and so as we understand that that our words and our speech and our conduct matters we ask God to grow Us in wisdom and stature and in righteousness we train ourselves we we um we we grow and we become more mature that all matters and at the same time we hold on to the mystery of God trusting in Him trusting that he's present even when it doesn't seem so amen um at this time we're going to respond in prayer and in worship as we wrap up our service if I could get the offering prayer person Seth come on up
