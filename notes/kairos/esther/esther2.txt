sing some awesome songs and you feel so inspired right and so that's totally fine okay um we're in the Book of Esther we started the Book of Esther last week and so we're going into the second chapter of the Book of Esther and today's title we're going to learn a little bit of uh about something called a myrtle tree towards the end even for me I had no idea there was even a tree called the Myrtle tree and so as I looked up some of the information about it I found found it to be very yeah deeply encouraging and I hope this sermon will be encouraging to all of us the life of Esther that we see in chapter two this part this episode of Esther's life will be encouraging especially for people who may have um I don't know for one reason or another like dismissed yourselves dismiss yourselves as if as though God were already done with you or because of circumstances or maybe even the choices in life you may have um committed to you you carry this idea that I I just don't belong how can God use me to accomplish what he wants to do um in the grander scheme of things and if you've ever wrestled with that I think Esther chapter 2 provides us with tremendous encouragement to get out of that mindset to have a greater degree of Hope and so let's take a look at the Book of Esther chapter 2 um I showed this last week it's happening in the Persian Empire Era um this is where the story of Esther comes to us and then the location where it's the city of Susa which is the capital of of the great superpower of its day the Persian Empire uh King xeres is the king that is currently ruling when Esther's story takes place and he's the fourth um appointed King in the Persian Empire so let's pick up from chapter 2 and we'll read a good chunk of scripture and then I'll provide some um insights as contemporary readers looking into this ancient text and then after we look at some of those points poers we're going to two things that I I believe the author wants us to walk away with the encouragements that the author hopes that we will walk away with as well okay so verse one later when King xery's Fury had subsided he remembered Vash and what she had done and what he had decreed about her then the king's personal attendance proposed let a search be made for a beautiful young V for beautiful young virgins for the king and let the king appoint Commissioners in every province of his realm to bring all these beautiful young women into the heram at the Citadel of Susa let them be placed under the care of hegi the king's unic who is in charge of the women and let beauty treatments be given to them and let the young woman who pleases the king be Queen instead of vashi okay vashi had been deposed uh this advice appealed to the king and he followed it now now there was in The Citadel of Susa a Jew of The Tribe of Benjamin named Mori son of Jer the son of shim and the son of kich who had been carried into Exile from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon among those taken captive with king jein king of Judah uh morai had a cousin named hadasa whom he had brought up because she was she had neither father nor mother this young woman who was also known as Esther had a lovely figure um that was year three of the king's Reign um we read towards the end of chapter 2 we're into about year seven now so there is about four years that has passed from chapter 1 to chapter 2 and so what has the king been doing for the last four years one he has been going off and battling and trying to win um defeat the the Greek Empire it wasn't an Empire yet but the Greek as as people and just like his father Darius he fails to conquer Greek remember the 300 Sparta we are Sparta you know you cannot conquer us so that's what happened okay it's all so much of it was theatrics but what's true is um King xeres fails to conquer Greece so he returns and he pays all of his now attention inwardly and in doing so this kind of lustful King the the Greek historian in describing what was taking place in X's um rule says um after the defeat after the military defeat the King's life became one of sensual overindulgence just imagine what that could be like just all he lived for was his own pleasure for himself in fact historically was found that he was starting to engage in marital affairs with some of his own officers WI lives and it soed such deep um seeds of betrayal um bitterness anger about a decade and a half later one of the officers commits assassination and kills King xeri stabs him right in his own bedroom okay that was the end of King X's life but you can imagine for about 15 19 years he was just a Playboy in the um Persian Empire he had all the wealth and all the power now he had because he lost to the Greeks um he lost a lot of The credibility and um he had lost also a lot of the resources and it was in this condition that the king's attendant they come knowing that the king is more or less acting like a juvenile and saying you know what we understand you banished the queen four years ago and I think what you should do is find another young beautiful woman I mean this Empire is 127 um provinces just find one young beautiful woman and let her win this contest and bring her over and why don't you make her the new Queen so that's the setup for the story where Esther and morai are now introduced so the author goes on to say this is where morai and Esther enters a scene into the story and when morai is introduced like some of the descriptors is his Heritage a Jew from The Tribe of Benjamin and he the writer also goes on to describe a man um descendant of a man named Kish so Kish tribe of um Benjamin now if some of you are like Bible nerds and you hear Tribe of Benjamin a father named Kish you may be sharp enough to say aha I know who you're talking about okay it's morai in this situation but you might be referring to King Saul a famous King the first king of Israel the first king of Israel was also from The Tribe of Benjamin and his father was named Kish so Mori is actually related to King Saul and that relationship that Heritage actually plays a significant part in the story of Esther to be continued that will be in chapter 3 okay so you'll have to come back to church to see why that matters next week Pastor Phil may be preaching that okay anyway that's next week we're going to focus on Esther um now when Esther is introduced in this story she is first introduced by her Hebrew name her Jewish name even though rest of the story carries on the name Esther but here at its introduction she is hadasa and I think that key word hadasa the Jew Jewish Heritage the Jewish identity it provides not only the encouragement for us later on but it also provides an insight into what is going on in Esther's life well into the Exile Community had been taken from the from Jerusalem lost both of our parents she's now orphaned has been living in Babylonian and now Persian Empire and that is the setting the the backdrop where the author says she is hadasa but she is also Esther and the author is intentionally pointing she's the only one that gets the two names and the author is giving our attention pointing our attention to her bicultural identity as a Jew she learned the Torah she learned the laws the levitical laws that had been handed to the Jews for um Generations um she had customs and practices that the Jewish um customs and the cultural and religious practices maintained but she was also a Persian dressed in the Persian clothing um looking more Persian than as an um he Hebrew and so this idea of having dual kind of cultural background identity I I I believe it helps us to understand some of the tension that she's experiencing now the Hebrew writer uses several times in this in this text more of the passive language and that helps us to understand Esther had no control over ending up in Persia she was taken in fact in chapter 2:8 she was taken to the heram later on she was taken to the king's chamber the Jews had come and they're living in Susa because the Exiles were also taken from Israel for none of these things she had any kind of volitional will it wasn't her choice of her own but rather the forces that were Beyond her the decision makers that were Beyond her were guiding her or taking her from place to place now I realize a lot of you I and I I realize you know it's not everyone's not everyone isn't Asian-American but um many of you were born in the states like my generation we were immigrants okay are there some people who actually are immigrants here okay a few of you guys okay a little bit so I get it like most of you were born US citizens from birth um for me some of us we we were brought and you know when we were brought to I was 8 years old my mom and dad did not sit us down and asked us how we felt about moving to United States they're like hey we're thinking about moving all the way from Korea to us what do you think about that you want to do it probably at that age I didn't even know United States existed we were just put on a plane one day I remember showing up where are we going we're going to the airport oh we're going to the airport and we're moving to America what's America like we had no idea my first day at school as a second grade kid I had no they didn't teach me one word of English I didn't know a yes or a no I at least they could have said I don't understand they could have at least taught us I don't understand but I was just put into the second grade into my class and completely non-asian setting up in NorCal and I remember like kids would come up try to make some small talks say things to me the teachers would ask questions and it was the exam that did it my first day I had to take a spelling exam and I remember sitting in front of a spelling exam that I used to do well in Korea right and I I had no idea what to even do and so I did what any eight-year-old kid would do I started crying yeah I just started crying because I didn't know what else to do the teacher didn't know what to do now we have this immigrant kid who doesn't speak any word of English is crying she has no idea if something is physically I still remember she just picked me up just literally picked me up and ran me down the hall to the nurse's office put me in the nurse's bed and just left and then the nurse called my mom thankfully my mom spoke a little bit of English to know that she had to pick up the crying son of hers anyway all that to say oh inner healing memory okay all that to say all that to say I had no choice Esther had no choice she was in Persia picking up all on all the culture the biculturalism simply because of other forces that were at work now we know from the whole story of Esther it all connects and points to the Salvation of the Jews but in that moment she had no idea what was going on and a lot of times life is like that um anyway I'm getting way ahead of my notes okay I'm going to come back to this I'm going to keep reading so in verse 12 as Esther is now in this heram her number comes up here's verse 12 before a young woman's turn came up came to go into there's a little bit of actually Prison history before a young woman's turn came to go into King's ures she had to complete 12 months of beauty treatment prescribed for the women 6 months of oil and myr and six months with perfume and cosmetics this is beauty treatment verse 13 and this is how she would go to the king anything she wanted was given to her to take with her from the heram to the king's Palace in the evening she would go there and in the morning return to another part of the Herm to care to the care of um shash the king's unicorn who was in now charge of the concubines she's going from her in the heram where she was a virgin to a different place where she is now no longer a virgin she would not return to the king unless he was pleased with her and summoned her by name so it's a little bit of Persian history if you will this is how they treated the women and you know doing some research for this sermon and and looking at how other pastors and other people have approached this text I have seen the title even in commentary that this was like a beauty pageant and Esther wins the beauty pageant and so she becomes the queen of the most powerful superpower this is not a beauty pageant at least my understanding of beauty pageant because beauty pageant win or lose you get to go home you have all the dignity to at least go home back to your family this is not a beauty pageant this is probably more like sex slaves it just the Bible doesn't use it that way because this was normal in the Persian culture because historically what we find not only here but other historians and other commentaries have made comment on this after spending that one night in King's bed providing the sex that he demanded remember this is the overindulgent pig headed of a man the woman then returned to the heram to the concubines where she would spend the rest of her life it may be a little bit luxurious because you have the palace going for you and yet you've lost all dignity because you're in complete desolate seclusion you can never leave the Herm again why to to marry another human being another person to just start your own family nor could you return to the family that you were taken from okay this is not a beauty pageant that Esther wins she was the most beautiful but not a beauty pageant um and this is where we find Esther this this is where we first meet Esther in the story um let me just read one more section and we'll get into the two truth um when the turn came now Esther's turn has come up when the turn came among the many women right when the turn came from Esther to go to the king she asked for nothing other than what hegi the king's unic who was in charge of the heram suggested and Esther won the favor of everyone who saw her and she was taken from King xeres in the um in the Royal residence in the 10th month on the month of tbth in the seventh year of his Reign now the King was attracted to eser more than any of the other women and she won his favor and approval more than any of the other virgins so he set a royal crown on her head and made her Queen instead of ASI and the King gave her a great banquet Esther's banquet for all his Nobles and officials he proclaimed the holiday throughout the province and distributed gifts with royal liberality so Esther wins his favor um you don't have to read in between the lines to imagine how she won that you don't know how Esther felt the the word of God doesn't really articulate what was going on in Esther's mind but I do think I arrive at two situation two things that I can pick up God is Sovereign Even in our worst circumstances God is Sovereign Even in our worst circumstances that we had no control over had no volition no will of your own did you end up in those situations again the passive voice she was taken she was taken to the king she was taken to the heram she did not do it willingly saying ooh ooh ooh I want to win the beauty pageant she had no control over this part of her life can only imagine the word doesn't say Bible doesn't describe but I could only imagine just a woman wondering what has happened in my life my parents have been exiled my country has been destroyed my mom and dad are both dead thankfully my cousin took care of me and raised me as his daughter and one day the King's Men show up and simply because she had Beauty she's taken and you count you're going no questions asked have you been in situations where you feel like how did I end up here by what force of nature or doings of other people have I ended up where I'm at currently you almost feel like you've been abandoned and you feel like if anything as Sons and Daughters people who want to be in God's purposes and God's Good Will doing lots of good things you just wonder is God even doing anything in my life let alone through me for the sake of others um I I hope this helps there's a professor Dr Robert Clinton at Fuller Seminary he teaches on um leadership es especially among Christians um among he's at a seminary so he teaches principles of leadership but he especially did a study on all of the Christian leaders in the Bible in church history contemporary Christian leaders and as he's done a an extensive research and study on this coming up with you know certain principles he wrote a book called making of a leader and recognizing the lessons and the stages of leadership development I think that subtitle is key recognizing recognizing the lessons that are going on in each phase each stages of your development as Believers as Sons and Daughters phase one is the only one I want to talk about here because in phase one it's called Sovereign foundations and here God providentially providentially without your knowing without your doing without your valtion at times God providentially works through family environment historic events and other things societies cultures a lot of these things that are going on and this begins at Birth you had no choice in who your parents were going to be you had no choice where you were going to be born all of that is the Divine Sovereign foundations that God is doing at in you at that time um you might find it hard to believe that God was working through your family or your environment especially especially if these were not necessarily God Godly influences and sometimes even painful perhaps even ungodly influences but he was I think that's the key that he discovered that God's sovereignty was always at work even in this phase of your life and keep in mind that it is often difficult to see the importance of all these items until later on later on when you get to phase two phase three I'm still kind of working through Phase 2 and in the early stages of getting into phase three and I I'll talk about those some other time but phase two um is a long one and some of you especially 20s um 30s you're in the middle of that phase two and it's a good season good time to reflect on The Sovereign foundations of your life as Believers knowing theologically God has has been Sovereign and in control anything from why am I living here how did I end up here without any valtion a decision of my own mysteriously that God is behind the scenes with forces at work moving from one place to another and I do refer to sometimes these situations are painful and it is one where I wouldn't want anyone to be in but you've gone through Seasons where you wonder where is God what is God doing in some of these painful seasons of my life if we're cynic if we don't think more biblically it's easy for us to land into the conclusion I don't think there is a God or I don't think if there is a God he's all that good nor loves me and that's why the word of God guards us from falling off the off the rails and we have to remind ourselves in some of these Seasons that a good God is still Sovereign and is building up the foundations of doing something that even you do not yet understand what will come out of my life for the kingdom of God but God is Sovereign he is good James when he's writing to the church that is under heavy persecution he reminds them you know God cannot be tempted by evil nor does he use evil to tempt anyone that's not his methodology and so some bad things have happened but the source of it the author of it is not God himself he's Sovereign and divine but he is not the author of evil John 1 15 1 John 15 says God is light and in him there isn't any Darkness there is no darkness in him at all he would never use dark methods despicable methods just to gain an advantage for his kingdom first Corinthians 14:33 Paul says God is not the author of confusion he is not the author of confusion and the biblical writers The Inspired writers put some guard rails so we don't fall off the track the story of Esther tells us there were some really tough times being orphaned being taken being taken now as a prostitute being taken to a Despicable Pagan King's bedroom being taken and you're just wondering what is going on they are painful I don't deny that I'm reminded of a book title I I I saw years ago you know God never wastes a pain and I don't mean to say that flippantly or callously having gone through pain in my own life I can see God never wastes of pain and even in the worst of the circumstances that make us feel like maybe we're disqualified maybe we're abandoned forgotten maybe we're off to the sideline and the other people with a good pedigree and the good great resumes maybe God wants to use them no God is still accomplishing his great works his best Works in and through you I hope that encourages us the second point is God is Sovereign Even in our worst moments have you had some really bad moments in your life where it was under your control it was your volition it was your will and you just chose the wrong choice you went down the track that you know that's not what Christians do that's not what children of God that's not the direction we should be taking we've all committed to that think about Esther's story and the let's put it next to another biblical figure in the Old Testament exiled living under a pagan King under um Pagan rituals and rules and laws how did he respond in his situation his name is Daniel do you remember why Daniel was thrown into the Den of Lions we went over the Book of Daniel I think a year and a half ago in our church remember why he ended up in the Den of Lions because he actually continued to pray when the edict was no more prayer he say I don't care what the king says I don't care who holds all the power I'm going to pray and he ended up there remember earlier on in the Book of Daniel like eating all kinds of foods that were immoral to the Jews unclean and Daniel said could you excuse us from eating these kind of foods somehow the arrangement was made they can eat just the foods that were acceptable to a he Hebrew to a Jew they got healthier like from day one you can tell Daniel was a Jew practicing his Jewish faith the three friends that ended up in the furnace the fire why because they refused to Bow before the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar had erected and set up saying everyone want must bow to it and they remember the laws of Moses saying make no other Idols before me nor bow to any other gods now we look at Daniel and say that's the kind of faith we want to live that's the kind of people we hold up why is Esther in the book in the Bible think about Esther sure she was taken sure seems like there was no volition what about Mori cousin the parental figure rather than standing up against the king's edict looking for young beautiful virgins why don't you do something about it as a Hebrew as a Jewish man of Faith this was so bothersome read this 15th century Jewish commentator Abraham saah he says now when morai heard the king's Herald is it there yeah now when the Mori when morai heard the king's Herald announcing that whoever has the daughter or the sister should bring her to the king to have intercourse with an uncircumcised Heathen why did he not risk his life to take her to some deserted place to hide until the danger would pass right that's what I would have done as a dad he should have been killed rather than submit to such an act why was he not more careful where was his righteousness his piety his Valor his courage now she also Esther too should by right have tried to commit suicide before allowing herself to have intercourse with him King xeres just paints a whole another light of chapter 2 Book of Esther now we know Esther does become a woman of Faith she does say if I perish then I perish she gets to that moment but in Chapter 2 Esther and morai they don't seem to be the heroes of Faith like Daniel was living under the same circumstances in the same situation if anything it seems like they're kind of going along with things Jesus tells us we're to live in the world yes it's going to be part of our responsibility as light but we're not supposed to live like the world of the world in fact Esther was such doing such a great job Mori actually tells Esther make sure no one knows you're a Jew keep your nationality hidden you know in that time nationality hiding your nationality had everything to do with the Torah their whole culture their whole nationality eth it was D deriven from their belief in the laws of Moses so what Mori is actually telling her to do is eat what they offer you dress like them talk like them stop practicing the Sabbath CU that'll identify you as a Jew don't do anything that the word of God has commanded you to do that we've been doing stop doing that make sure you keep that identity hidden in fact when the king finally calls you go to bed with this Heathen King you know it's easy for us 2,000 years 3,000 years later reading this text to say this is horrible they're horrible people they're not men and women of faith and it's easy for us to cast judgment but before we do don't we struggle with this too hav we had moments the worst moments when we could have shined as the light into the Gentile world or the broken world but we kind of took the shortcut we decided to compromise just a little not enough to lose my entire identity as a Christian but just enough I'm thankful that chapter 2 is in the Bible because it it's encouraging it's encouraging that others have also gone down this really challenging path they say that the book of um Esther was most likely written by Mori he was the author to this book knew the story but he was also writing to provide encouragement to to the Jews who were spread out in the diaspora after the Exile Exile had crushed any kind of government of monarchy they've had Kings and rulers and governments they've gone back and they were constantly in that Palestinian land ruled by other Empires other cultures other laws now they got to practice some of their own until it conflicted with the laws of the land and it was in those places is where many of the Jews in diaspora would be wondering what do I do how do I navigate this conflict perhaps some of them rose up just like Daniel did if I you know even if not faith of Shadrach mishak abedo even if I lose everything I'll stand by my God but I'm sure many others had some really bad moments moments where they just kind of went along rather than standing up against immoral pressures just continue to play the part the Book of Esther is a great encouragement to say even if you find yourself in the shoes of Esther God is not done God is Raising people up to accomplish his purpose to that he wants to accomplish in you and through you don't be so hard on yourselves and we come back now to the Myrtle tree anyone hear of the Myrtle tree anyone like if you saw a myrtle tree you would be able to point out that's a myrtle tree anybody here okay so I'm not the only one good even after looking up bunch of myrtle tree pictures I don't think I could find a myrtle tree if there was one right in front of me palm tree I can tell but not mytle tree hadasa this is why I believe the author introduces the Book of Esther and as Esther is getting with a Hebrew name hadasa hadasa actually means myrtle tree and it's the lessons of a myrtle tree the metaphor of a myrtle tree that really speaks the words of encouragement to to not only the Jewish audience but to us as well today about six times the Myrtle tree is mentioned in scripture just either as it being there or it having a significant like metaphor a meaning and here is one of them Isaiah CH 55 verse 13 instead of the thorn bush will grow the Juniper and instead of the Briars the Myrtle will grow so again instead of the thorn bush and instead of Briar in its place junipers and here's that myrtle tree that will grow basically Isaiah had been giving prophecies warning the Israelites you need to repent otherwise you're going to be punished Exile the discipline is coming and once that happens Jerusalem will be just laid to desolate land it'll be waste it'll be like desert it'll be where the The Thorn brush and Briars grow But ultimately because of God's faithfulness he will bring you back and what was once desolate will be a place filled with Myrtle trees with the juniper trees once again Jerusalem will flourish once again that was Isaiah's meaning in his prophecy once again later like Zechariah also prophesies and he uses the Myrtle tree and the rabbis in a book called The talud explains in that context chapter 1 ver8 Myrtle trees meant those who are righteous Myrtle trees are those who are righteous so if we look at Dasa Esther's name in Hebrew that the author intentionally inserts into the book he could have wrote the whole story just using the word Esther using the name Esther but inserts her name is AA right at the beginning I think is aiming to encourage this body of Christ who has gone through all kinds of tough really painful circumstances but also those who have failed to really stand stand up when the opportunity was given and rather we chose compromise the worst of us came up we regret it may be ashamed we should have stood up we should have been more Christlike and yet we didn't and in those situations I think it's easy for us to become the worst critics of ourselves well God's done with me now God can't use me now God uses those Daniels God uses people who have a great pedigree a great education where do I stand no I think Esther encourages us to say God is AC accomplishing and still writing his story in you and through you they say that a myrtle tree actually is an evergreen tree in desert-like conditions of the Middle East um even when the conditions worsen and other trees are dying they say interestingly Myrtle trees can survive that condition and I'm not sure how many trees can do this okay but they do say if you just chop up a myrtle tree down to its roots its roots are so strong it'll grow another trunk and all of the branches with it the name hadasa carries this significance the last thing about the Myrtle tree is it grows really slowly about 10 12 Ines per year which sounds like a lot to me okay I don't like doing gardening that's that's a lot of okay but it it grows really slowly and it doesn't achieve its full height for a whole hundred years takes a hundred years for a myrtle tree to finally say I've arrived when I take the word righteous um that the Hebrews saw the Myrtle trees as when I see the the Myrtle trees it's its conditions and the way they are I think the name hadasa it is such it's what the first um listeners picked up on she is hadasa who has been uprooted from Jerusalem outside of her control she's more Persian than she is Jewish in fact she's been asked to hide the Jewish Heritage the law what's given the Jews the identity and it's in that condition where God is saying I'm not done with you you are a myrtle tree in fact I see you as righteous because you have been justified by Christ and you may have made some really poor choices this week last week last month this season and rather than con convincing yourself I'm no longer qualified nothing good can come out of this life now I think the promise of the Lord and the goodness of God is that he is still writing the story to accomplish his amazing purposes that we may not even be aware of that's coming down the line in the chapters ahead of Our Lives we shouldn't despair to continue to hope the truth is yeah even in our world worst circumstances that led us to hear or even in the worst choices we made mysteriously amazingly God works through them he saves a whole nation the covenanted people through whom Christ comes so beyond our understanding that's Esther chapter 2 and um like I said next week show up and we'll see why being part of the tribe of um Benjamin and a son to Kish has connection for Esther okay worship team would you come forward
