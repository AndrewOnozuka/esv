## Sermon Information
- **Date:** May 29, 2022
- **Church:** Kairos Christian Church
- **Speaker:** Pastor Phillip Chen
- **Title:** Wisdom and Folly

## Historical Context
- Esther 5 follows Esther’s decision to approach King Xerxes despite the risk of death.
- The Persian custom dictated that anyone who approached the king uninvited could be executed unless the king extended his scepter (Esther 4:11).
- Esther had fasted for three days, seeking divine favor before making her appeal (Esther 4:16).
- Meanwhile, Haman’s hatred for Mordecai grows, leading to further schemes.
- This chapter highlights the contrast between wisdom and folly—between Esther’s patience and prudence and Haman’s arrogance and impulsiveness.

## Summary of Chapter 5
- Esther courageously enters the king’s court and is welcomed as he extends his golden scepter (Esther 5:2).
- Instead of immediately presenting her request, Esther invites the king and Haman to a banquet (Esther 5:4).
- At the banquet, the king again inquires about her request, but Esther invites them to another banquet the following day (Esther 5:8).
- Haman, elated by his exclusive invitation, leaves the banquet full of pride (Esther 5:9).
- However, his joy turns to anger when he sees Mordecai, who still refuses to bow to him (Esther 5:9-10).
- Enraged, Haman devises a plan to have Mordecai executed and orders the construction of gallows (Esther 5:14).

## Key Themes & Lessons

1. **Wisdom in Patience and Strategy**
   - Esther does not rush her appeal but carefully prepares the setting to gain the king’s favor.
   - Her prudence and patience reflect wisdom in handling difficult situations (Proverbs 19:2, Proverbs 14:29).
   - Esther embodies the principle of careful speech and action, demonstrating how wisdom leads to success.

2. **The Danger of Pride and Foolishness**
   - Haman’s arrogance blinds him to his impending downfall (Proverbs 16:18).
   - His inability to control his emotions leads him to act rashly, setting the stage for his demise (Proverbs 29:11).
   - Haman has every reason to be joyful, yet his bitterness over Mordecai robs him of satisfaction—demonstrating how unchecked pride can steal joy.

3. **Spiritual Warfare and Influence**
   - The rage inside Haman is an example of how spiritual battles manifest in the physical realm.
   - The enemy often amplifies emotions like anger, jealousy, and insecurity to wreak havoc in our lives and relationships.
   - Haman’s downfall begins when he allows his bitterness to dictate his actions, showing how unchecked emotions can lead to destruction (James 1:14-15).

4. **Divine Providence at Work**
   - Esther’s favor before the king and the unfolding events highlight God’s unseen hand in guiding history (Romans 8:28, Proverbs 21:1).
   - Even when God’s name is not mentioned, His presence is evident in orchestrating outcomes.
   - The contrast between Haman’s temporary success and his eventual downfall reminds us that God’s justice prevails in the end (Psalm 37:7-10).

5. **The Power of Influence and Position**
   - Esther’s influence as queen allows her to advocate for her people (Esther 4:14).
   - This emphasizes the importance of using one’s position for justice and righteousness (Micah 6:8, Proverbs 31:8-9).
   - God places people in roles of influence for a purpose, and recognizing this calling can lead to transformational impact.

## Connection to Modern Life
- Exercising wisdom and patience in high-stakes situations can lead to more favorable outcomes.
- Pride and unchecked emotions can lead to self-destruction, highlighting the need for humility (James 4:6, Philippians 2:3-4).
- The enemy still seeks to amplify bitterness and insecurity in our hearts to lead us away from God’s peace.
- Even when God seems absent, He is actively working behind the scenes (Isaiah 41:10).
- Recognizing the influence we have in our respective roles can encourage us to advocate for truth and justice (Esther 4:14, 2 Timothy 1:7).

## Discussion Questions
- What does it look like to be prudent and thoughtful in our speech, words, and lives today?
- Have you ever allowed pride or bitterness to rob you of joy? How can you guard your heart against this?
- How seriously do you consider spiritual warfare in your daily life? What areas of your life does the enemy try to amplify to lead you away from God?
- Have you ever questioned God’s justice, wondering why good people suffer and the wicked seem to prosper?

## Looking Ahead
- The tension between Haman and Mordecai escalates, setting the stage for a dramatic reversal in the coming chapters.
- Esther’s second banquet will bring the long-awaited revelation of her true request to the king (Esther 7:3-4).
