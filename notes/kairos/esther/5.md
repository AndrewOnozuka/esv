## Sermon Information
- **Date:** May 29, 2022
- **Church:** Kairos Christian Church
- **Speaker:** Pastor Peter Yoon
- **Title:** Wisdom and Folly

## Historical Context
- Esther 5 follows Esther’s decision to approach King Xerxes despite the risk of death.
- The Persian custom dictated that anyone who approached the king uninvited could be executed unless the king extended his scepter (Esther 4:11).
- Esther had fasted for three days, seeking divine favor before making her appeal (Esther 4:16).
- Meanwhile, Haman’s hatred for Mordecai grows, leading to further schemes.

## Summary of Chapter 5
- Esther courageously enters the king’s court and is welcomed as he extends his golden scepter (Esther 5:2).
- Instead of immediately presenting her request, Esther invites the king and Haman to a banquet (Esther 5:4).
- At the banquet, the king again inquires about her request, but Esther invites them to another banquet the following day (Esther 5:8).
- Haman, elated by his exclusive invitation, leaves the banquet full of pride (Esther 5:9).
- However, his joy turns to anger when he sees Mordecai, who still refuses to bow to him (Esther 5:9-10).
- Enraged, Haman devises a plan to have Mordecai executed and orders the construction of gallows (Esther 5:14).

## Key Themes & Lessons
1. **Wisdom in Patience and Strategy**
   - Esther does not rush her appeal but carefully prepares the setting to gain the king’s favor.
   - Her prudence and patience reflect wisdom in handling difficult situations (Proverbs 19:2, Proverbs 14:29).
   
2. **The Danger of Pride and Foolishness**
   - Haman’s arrogance blinds him to his impending downfall (Proverbs 16:18).
   - His inability to control his emotions leads him to act rashly, setting the stage for his demise (Proverbs 29:11).
   
3. **Divine Providence at Work**
   - Esther’s favor before the king and the unfolding events highlight God’s unseen hand in guiding history (Romans 8:28, Proverbs 21:1).
   - Even when God’s name is not mentioned, His presence is evident in orchestrating outcomes.
   
4. **The Power of Influence and Position**
   - Esther’s influence as queen allows her to advocate for her people (Esther 4:14).
   - This emphasizes the importance of using one’s position for justice and righteousness (Micah 6:8, Proverbs 31:8-9).

## Connection to Modern Life
- Exercising wisdom and patience in high-stakes situations can lead to more favorable outcomes.
- Pride and unchecked emotions can lead to self-destruction, highlighting the need for humility (James 4:6, Philippians 2:3-4).
- Even when God seems absent, He is actively working behind the scenes (Isaiah 41:10).
- Recognizing the influence we have in our respective roles can encourage us to advocate for truth and justice (Esther 4:14, 2 Timothy 1:7).

## Looking Ahead
- The tension between Haman and Mordecai escalates, setting the stage for a dramatic reversal in the coming chapters.
- Esther’s second banquet will bring the long-awaited revelation of her true request to the king (Esther 7:3-4).
