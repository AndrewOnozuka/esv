gender no status and just no ethnicities It Came Upon all people um giving us all the experience of freedom and becoming sons and daughters in the Lord and so we remember also Pentecost Sunday today as well okay so in our preaching for the last five weeks if we have the slide we've been going to the Book of Esther and it's been a joy for me a lot of learning for both Pastor Phil and myself as we've been going through this series and today we come to chapter six of the book and I titled this sermon after thinking about it everyone needs a thorn everyone needs a thorn okay I don't know the last time perhaps you've had like you know a sliver or Thorn just kind of prick you and it got stuck there it's very annoying it's that the kind of thorn that we're talking about um I'll come back to this title later as apostle Paul talks about the thorn on the side of his flesh that was actually tormenting him it was just so painful that he asked for it to be removed several times and yet the spiritual truth out of that passage is you know what everyone needs a thorn as much as we don't want it nor like it the truth is everyone needs a thorn the chapter that we're about to go through some have said is the funniest the most comical chapter in all of scripture okay so if there's ever a time you're reading through scripture and you come to a point and you're like I can't believe this is happening and your reaction to the narrative is actually bursting out laughing this would be appropriate response to Esther chapter 6 the way that there's a great reversal the irony the comical irony here the character hymon that we're going to look at and if you find yourself laughing at his face you know for a long time I had no idea what lol meant I thought it meant laughing out loud oh no lots of laughter I thought it meant lots of laughters and then until my wife just laughed at my face and said it does not stand for lots of laughter but this would be one of those LOL chapters in all of the scripture and so let's get into it into this most comical chapter of the book that night the king could not sleep so he ordered the book of The Chronicles the record of his Reign to be brought in and read to him and it was found recorded there that morai had exposed bana and tures the two kings of officers who guarded the doorway Who had who had conspired to assassinate King xeres what honor and recognition has morai received for this the king asked nothing has been done for for him his attendance answered so this is following chapter 5 where that night has taken place for hmon hmon is the bad guy right he's the antagonist hmon is really angry with morai they've had this long Feud going back generation upon generation and morai this agagite he is just irate and so angry with uh I'm sorry hmon is so angry with morai that in chapter 5 Hon's wife and a group of friends they say you know what if you hate him so much why don't you just kill him just execute the guy I mean all the Jews are going to be executed at the end of the year anyways so just get a head start on this one Jewish man that's so just getting under your skin and why don't you execute him and heon thought that was a that's a great idea I'm going to listen to this idea and that night he goes up and he raises a stake a pole 75 F feet high just to kill one Jewish person so that he can impale the body of morai on this really highly lifted so that everyone can see Paul that he had just raised up all night long now you have to kind of appreciate what hmon is trying to do it it does not take 70 feet of wood to kill a man but he's going through all the trouble to raise this structure so high about five or six stories is tall to impale the body of morai but he wants more than that he wants to actually humiliate not only morai and his family but just all the Jews you only go through that kind of a trouble that kind of like public spectacle if you want to humiliate someone and the height of this pole that he's erected just tells you that he wanted to completely humiliate all of the Jews to say this is what happens to people who oppose me who will not bow down to me so it's that night in which hon had put up this poll and he's now on his way to go to see the king so that he can get the permission to follow through with the execution I mean he is so livid and so angry that he can't even wait until the next day he needs to go and get the king's permission in the middle of the night so this is where you're going to see a series of coincidence just line up one after another after another and you're like no way no way was that you just cannot believe these coincidence are lining up one after another after another and the only conclusion is the conclusion of the Book of Esther which is God's hand is directing traffic there is something Supernatural behind the scenes when all these ducts are being lined up in order just for the great reversal the conclusion is God is in on this so it's that night that of all the nights King xeres just has trouble falling asleep usually he slept well and following chapter 5 he actually is coming back from a party where he just drank a lot of alcohol and one thing we know about alcohol is it helps people go to bed really well at night he's had a great satisfying banquet he's drank some alcohol he's satisfied and rather than going to sleep the Hebrew actually says the Sleep ran away from the King it's a pictoral language the Hebrew language and the way it's written is the Sleep actually fled and ran away from King xeres himself so that he could not just go to bed like a baby so he asks for the reading of the Chronicles he's saying you know what I got some time I can't fall asleep things are on my mind so why don't you read bring me a book and tell me what's been going on in the kingdom and so the servants grab one of the Scrolls and as they begin to read from the Chronicles another coincidence lines up and this coincidence is about five years five years before this night there was an assassination attempt on King xeres couple of the officers they weren't too happy and so they wanted to kill the officers and let's read about it it's in in Chapter 2 during the time morai was sitting at the king's gate bana and tures two of the king's officers who guarded the doorway became angry and they conspired to assassinate King xeres but morai found out about the plot and told Queen Esther who in turn reported it to the king giving credit to morai and when the report was investigated and found to be true two officials were impaled on on the polls and all this was recorded in the book of the annals in the presence of the king so this is an event that takes place about five years ago now five years ago we know that King xeres had that failed campaign against Greek he had come home and historians would say that all he did was just focus now inwardly in home no more military campaigns and he just focused on his old his just own sensual indulgences he just wanted to please himself and one of the things that he engaged in was he actually had engaged in affairs with his officer wives so perhaps that was what was going on but you can imagine why bana and tures were angry were upset and they wanted to take Revenge by assassinating King xeres he wasn't a good King he wasn't worthy of rulership over this Empire but morai the Jew even recognizing nevertheless he is King reports the assassination of T the plans to King xeres so that it is foiled that took place about 5 years ago and here we are that night coincidentally as a king cannot fall asleep hman has just erected this pole to kill morai and he is reading about morai so he asks you know what's been done has anything been done for morai since he you know foiled this attempt at this assassination you could see the coincidence kind of lining up so the king said who's in the court who's out there this is the middle of the night still you got to just you can imagine the middle middle of night and now hmon had just entered the outer Court of the palace what a coincidence there too and to speak to the king about impaling morai on the pole he had set up for him and his attendants answered um hmon is standing in the court well bring him in the king ordered when hmon entered the king asked him what should be done should be done for a man the king Delights to honor should I do with people that I really like to promote and lift up and honor what should what should be done to a man like that and so this is where the author now gives us a little insight into Hon's inner thought his private thought life now heon thought to himself who is there that the king would rather honor me King has to be thinking about me isn't he so just again one coincidence after another in this the great irony we're about to see is both men of Power King xeres and hmon have one person on their mind it's hmon it it's morai they're both thinking about morai on Hon's part he cannot wait to humiliate morai impale him in that pole kill him and humiliate all of the Jews total utter destruction and humiliation is the one thing he has in mind when he thinks about morai but King xeres on a strange night where he should be sleeping like a baby is awakened and he is now thinking about morai but in his mind he's like no one honor this guy he needs to be honored and recognized for saving my own life now for king um xeres in that culture uh it would be very normal it was a very cultural practice to honor those that would bestow that that would literally save your life you can't just say hey thanks you have to publicly recognize him Kings would often give plots of land and give those people positions of power for saving his life life and in doing so what the King was actually doing was also gaining more popularity with the people because everyone then looks at the king as like wow he's such a generous King look at him he's giving land he's promoting and he's doing so many great things and so it kind of promotes this idea the more you bestow things for the king the greater favor that you would receive in return so in some sense King xeres has some political agenda in his mind as he thinks about honoring morai but again the irony here is they're both thinking about morai one to kill humiliate one to honor now for hmon he stuck on that phrase um the man the king Delights to honor and in his mind rather than asking the king who would that man be who would that person be he just assumes I must be that man I must be the guy that King loves and delights to honor um remember in chapter 3 hmon had actually been elevated by King xeres in chapter 3 it says elevating hmon and giving him a seed of Honor higher than that of all the other Nobles so hmon had gotten to the second seat of power position he is the most important man in the entire entire Persian Empire other than King xeres himself and now the king wants to do more now the king wants to give me more honor so he answers the king so he answer the king for the man the king Delights to honor have them bring a royal robe the King has worn and a horse the King has ridden one with the Royal Crest placed on his head then let the robe and horse be entrusted to one of the king's most noble princesses let them robe the man the king Delights to honor and lead him on the horse through the city streets proclaiming before him this is what is done for the man the king Delight to honor you hear that phrase the king Delights to honor the man the king Delights to honor three times it is just fixated in Hon's mind that I am the man the king Delights to honor and he cannot say this about himself he cannot say well King you know since we're talking about hmon let's let's just call it what it is he just says for the man the king likes to honor me um yeah why don't you give him the robe and the horse and this great fantasy pony ride and we'll take him through the streets of Susa and we'll say this is the the man the king likes to honor so he's got it all set up in his mind as I was reading it I was like wow he he had been dreaming about this for a long time he he didn't have to think long and hard about this question that came out of the blue and rather than answering the qu asking the question who do you have in mind King he is just spitting it out because he had been fantasizing about this moment for a very long time you know what asking for the robe you know what asking for the horse ride meant it meant asking for the throne in that culture when a robe and a horse was given as a privilege for that day literally people saw you as the king King of Persia he knew what he was asking for and for any of the princes that are around the Nobles to go around saying this is this is the King this is the king for the day and so for hmon being second in command he wanted more he wanted more and he had been fantasizing so it's easy for him to kind of concoct this plan right off the bat there's a little bit more of a um Insight I was listening to this pastor talk about this passage and he said wearing the king's robe also meant you would be bestowed all the magical Supernatural powers that kings were seen to possess and exercise for hmon he craved that magical Supernatural power as well to be able to make things happen on a whim you can see Hon's heart what hmon craved his desire his pride is just he's laced with it as he keeps saying for the man the king likes to honor so the king says you know that's a great idea hmon verse 10 go at once the king commanded hmon get the rope and the horse and do as you have suggested for Mori the Jew who sits at the king's gate and this is where like if I don't know if some of you artists and you're drawing like web Tunes or cartoons I think this is that moment where everything slows down from Hon's perspective like for more it's just like as the words are coming out of his lips you're like what his Jaws are dropping you know there's like steam coming out of Zs in his head his face is angry the whole time he thought it was going on his behalf and it's more that's what I imagine okay so I'm just being playful have you ever had one of those moments where you're with someone and someone kind of like important resp comes into the room and the person kind of waves in your direction and you're like oh my boss is waving at me but not really he's actually waving at the manager you were talking to you just happen to be like kind of on the side do you guys know what I'm talking about you ever like a girl or gal and the gal enters the quad and she's waving in your direction and you're like whoa she's waving at me but not really it's that other dude right okay you guys know what I'm talking about okay okay so the smiles the laughter that that's that's the humor right in this scenario that's going on okay I I could talk from experience because that happened to me a lot and you know who laughs at my face when that happens my wife my wife makes sure I hear the laughter that wasn't even for you and she just busts out laughing and embarrasses me I'm turning red okay that's what's going on that's the great reversal and the the the the Twist and the irony hmon thought I am the man that God wants or the king wants to honor but it's actually Mori so verse 11 so hmon got the robe and the horse and he robed morai can you imagine like passive aggressively like robing morai here you go right and let him on his horse back through the street proclaiming before him as these words were like literally like gagging out of his mouth this is what is done to the man the king Delights to honor this is the what is done and he is leaving morai on that fantasy parade that he was dreaming about this is the man that everyone should Honor on this day and recognize him as perhaps even King of Persia on this day know just to add insult to injury um other Jewish writers took this event and they added a little children's tale to this they decided let's make it a little bit more comical and so it's not in scripture it's not in the ible it's in more Jewish children's literature but on that day as hmon is leading this parade for Mori and everyone's paying him homage and honor Hon's daughter Hon's teenage daughter who's in her room hears what is going on on the street and she looks out and she has just as much hatred for the Jews she has just as much hatred as her dad so she's like oh my goodness they're honoring this guy Mori so she looks around the room picks up a basket full of dung and I'm not sure why the basket full of dung is there but she picks up a basket full of dung and she throws it at the head of morai on the horse she misses and she hits hmon right on the head okay and they tell that story to the Jewish kids you can imagine as you're laughing the kind of LOL that's going on among Jewish classes okay nothing else loud so sad you're your your pastor is not cool okay so that's the great irony that we see the comic um I don't know the comedy that we're looking at and the last section I think this tells the truth what is really happening to hmon but the spiritual truth why we all need we all need a thorn so afterwards morai returned to the king's Gates but hmon rushed home with his head covered D and grief okay if if the story is true okay with his head covered with grief and told zures his wife all of his friends everything that happened to him remember he went in the night before with the plan to impale morai but he is coming back completely completely humiliated himself and his advisers and his wife said to his wife zures said to him you know since morai before whom your downfall has started is of Jewish origin you cannot stand against him and you will surely come to ruin your life is over you picked the wrong fight hmon they say in the Hebrew you can kind of tell his friends and even his wife they're using the language where they're starting to before it's like we language but now it's oh you language they're kind of distancing themselves from hmon because Hon's going to get it they realize you picked the fight against morai and within one night the Great River river IAL has happened you know who morai is he is part of the Jewish people you picked the wrong fight the edict that you had written up to annihilate all the Jews oh boy now that Mori is on the king's horse wearing the king's robe even if it's for a day you're in trouble this is to your ruin and I don't know if zures recognize the theological implication behind this sure is's just speaking it from what she's seeing and what's what's happened just now when she says that you cannot stand against him because he is of Jewish origin think what it's implied there is you cannot go against the god of Israel you cannot pick a fight against the god of Abraham Isaac Jacob and think that your life will be okay you cannot go against his purposes and his will and think somehow you're going to get through life I hope we can all identify with hmon we laugh at him we can mock him can say boo his yeah throw some more dong over his head he's so evil the point of this is for us to recognize that we too can be so blinded by our pride by our ego we can become so conceited in our own society and in of ourselves we have no idea that we're resisting the will of God actually going against his purposes and his ways and in doing so the downfall we don't know when it's going to come but there will be a spiritual decline one day that hits us because of our own lack of humility and our own arrogance and our own desire to run my own life to pursue the things that it doesn't seem sinful is it wrong to be promoted at work is it wrong to get the best grades at school but it in in the pursuit of those things were vulnerable to so much pride we're susceptible to self-righteousness every one of us we're totally blind of seeing that our own words our own actions the choices we make even the stories we tell others the narratives that we make up think about it the reality was King xeres was about to honor morai that was reality The Narrative that was going floating in Hon's mind was completely off base the furthest thing from what was really going on from reality so the words we express to others the way in which we treat people the way we think about and carry out stories that we believe to be so true are they just offerings of your superiority complex full of yourselves not knowing that God has something completely different for us even Paul identified himself self that he can become a hmon just like that this is where the title of the message comes from 2 Corinthians chapter 12 Paul is writing to the Corinthian Church which is already a very arrogant church so he's dealing with the topic of arrogance the Corinthian Church they were pretty stuck up they were full of Pride full of themselves they were very gifted a lot of great things were happening and it unfortunately LED them to becoming very stuck therefore in order to keep me Paul from being conceited and this is the man that wrote about the love of God faith in Jesus Christ identifying himself as a servant as a slave to to Christ and even he says he admits that he struggled with pride he struggled in becoming conceited in Ministry so therefore in order to keep me from being conceited I was given a thorn in my flesh a messenger of Satan Satan to torment me and three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me but he said to me my grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weakness so that Christ's power May rest on me and that is why for Christ's sake I Delight in weakness I light in weakness and in insults in hardships in persecution and difficult and difficulties for when I'm weak then I'm strong well this is so counterintuitive about of our society everything we know since childhood we're praised for our um strengths because we rise above the others the competition we're actually rewarded for doing so our wits our strength whatever it may be the background we come from from so many factors that helps us to get further than than my competition and when weakness shows up we are to downplay it hide it get rid of it this is so counterintuitive to all that we know that is normal in life now to do well in school to get promoted there's nothing wrong with that that's not in and of itself sinful but it is the very place the very sea the the the soil in which Satan can also be at work making you believe that you did this because of your own Merit there is no acknowledgement or recognition of God's goodness and graciousness behind it whatsoever that all of the good things that you've garnered and gained is because of your hard work sure hard work is part of it we can easily become so self-righteous to the point where when we actually deal with somebody who's struggling and who's in a place of weakness we actually have disdain rather than compassion you want to know what Jesus said the one who loves little you're the kind of people who's been forgiven very little you haven't come to grips with your own sinfulness and your own Brokenness and because you've aced all the exams because you've aced all the spiritual exams because you've done all the things that are required by kind of religious places you give yourself a nice Pat in your back and when you come across somebody who fails to do so instead of having compassion and love judgment disdain you frown upon their weaknesses Paul must have struggled too and he knew at times he got conceited just like the rest of us he was gifted Miracles flowed out of his even handkerchief it was the greatest teacher the rabbi everyone looked to Paul waited for him to visit their church and city it's a soil in which being arrogant can easily and subtly happen so God in his grace and mercy and love for us just here's the thorn right in your side to remind you that it's not about you when Paul is saying I don't like this take it away from me it's tormenting me would you remove it I'd rather operate from my strength and hide the weaknesses I I don't want those things to be known you don't know what it does now we have no idea what this thorn in the side was Paul never elaborates or talks about it and so Scholars they they take kind of guesses and they're pretty good guesses the word for thorn is Al this kind of the word for weakness actually the weakness can imply like physical ailments like physical just things that handicap us at times Paul was actually growing blind and so some may think that oh because you're growing blind it's harder to do ministry and so he's asking the Lord would you remove this blindness I could heal the blind eyes of others how about my own and the Lord is saying no you go with it why because I want you to be humble and I want you to depend on my grace others say it may have been like opposition people who are always opposed to Paul whenever he arrived City to City he would the only thing he had was good news and to work hard at it but he would always get oppositions and people who would betray him he's say I cannot stand this I cannot do work with all these opposition would you remove them the Lord is saying no sometimes you need that for a little bit of Humble Pie others would say that he was a short little man who was like balding so when a short little man who was balding come comes and speaks people kind of yawn remember that one guy CU Paul spoke so long he fell he fell asleep through the window and he fell down he died okay that tells you that Paul was not the best speaker he was tired short little man balding didn't get the respect I don't know if Paul was saying god grow my hair God give me something whatever it may have been we don't know we don't know what the weakness is but but we understand the flip the switch in his theology says you know now I embrace and I Delight I Delight in my weakness and along with weakness he goes on to list like insults have you ever been insulted at work is it insulting to be working at a place where you know more than your boss your manager and you're like God I got to take orders from this guy this is the most insulting I've ever had to deal with you're like why am I here why did God put me into this kind of a place doesn't he know who I am hardships persecution I thought God was all about safety not about people wanting to get at me difficulties when all these things are part of my life circumstances rather than losing faith rather than walking away because this is a crisis that I cannot get over Paul flipped the switch and he says thank you thank you for this difficulty thank you for this weakness you for the thorn because say Thorn reminds me to stay humble last thing I want to do is become like hmon this thorn reminds me that what this life is really about is more grace more grace there is such a big supply of Grace in God's storage he has so much grace for us we just never come knocking and saying I need some of that rather we opt for self-sufficiency self-reliance self-management we'll do it we'll take care of it we got it under control God is saying ah all right you want it the hard way I'll give you the wedge Thorn what is your weakness what are the things that you want to hide from others because you're a little bit embarrassed if if it was exposed you'd be like oh I would lose respect they wouldn't look a upon me with the kind of respect they wouldn't take me seriously what is your weakness it's not a question of do I have a weakness it is what is it everyone needs a thorn when we can identify what that thorn is what that weakness is we turn to God and seek the grace of God and he gives us to us abundantly and this is what we learned from hmon this is what I learned and um now I told this story and was debating whether I should share but um you know when parents have to eat Humble Pie um like not sure if you had parents who actually apologized to you okay some of you are like yeah my parents you're cool with that they apologize I I don't recall one time in my life when my dad apologized to me after some incident and so you know I'm not trying to place all blame I take responsibility so I find it hard when I have to apologize to my children and I know I I need to but I find it difficult to eat that Humble Pie so this past Monday Memorial Day was a day off and the kids stayed home and you know when kids stay home and parents stay home one of two things can happen it could be a glorious day and lots of fun or it could be one of those days and it turned out to be one of those days okay the attitude the like a complaints all that was in the in the house and I just not having it okay um parents talk about oh wait till your child becomes a teenager oo you know that then then you really hit the challenges of parenting right so my kid is a teenager right um Nathan's a teenager and overall he's a good kid okay overall he's a good kid but that day he was a teenager he was acting like a teenager and so I did what you know not a Godly dad would do I just left them at the gym and I told him you get your own ride or you just walk home not not get your ride because that would be dangerous but you walk home okay and so don't report me to the police and delete this from the internet but I just told them just whatever you do I'm not giving you a ride because you're acting like this Punk teenagers teenager and so I I literally left now okay the gym is less than a mile away it's broad daylight okay we live in like penasquito it's safe and he later on when we talked he actually said it was good for me cardio gives me cardio like okay so so don't I'm not abusing okay the worst thing I do is just you know yell at him so you know I feel bad I don't feel good about what happened I feel like if Jesus were in the car the conversation would would have gone much differently um and now I have to make amends so that night um I actually started off with I was in the living room he was in his room Nathan come down here I was like Ah that's wrong too I should go up there so I said Nathan I'm coming up there so I went to his room I just sat down I I just started with Nathan I'm very sorry about what I did and how I behaved and what I said to you earlier this morning it just started and it was one of those like I'm sorry but you know I did it right because you deserved it you know that kind of sorry ology that sometimes gets done by parents I just said I'm sorry um and I did explain I think what was going on in my mind and why I did it and I I think I had crossed a line from I wanted to be a supportive parent but I think in the thick of things I became a controlling parent it's a fine line of trying to be supportive and there and trying to help and then you're at another level where you're trying to control um your son or the situation and I knew I had crossed the line so I apologized for that I explained what my intention was but I crossed the line good intentions and all I share this because um yeah I don't have it all together when it comes to Parenting I'm still work in progress I find myself still learning and I think that's every single one of us in some area of Our Lives we're expected to hold everything together sometimes we think that's what God expects of us too the truth is God actually gives us a thorn so that we don't end up like hmon who is so blinded by his ego his pride his sense of selfworth going after the promotions and the biggest prize of them all that he had no idea that he was actually going against God himself and we're not that it's a caricature in a sense we're not outright that rebellious let's not kid ourselves our sinfulness has a hint of rebellion that rejects the word of God rejects his will rejects what he desires for us and that's a constant battle we need to choose humility and at times embrace the weakness or failures in a strength glorifying culture learn how to do that the insults that are heaped at you the difficulties even the persecution the challenges that make us feel like why can't I get this right say Lord I offer this weakness to to you and receive your grace we're going to receive God's Grace today let's prepare our hearts as we receive the elements the Lord's elements is his grace upon us and so let's prepare um worship team would you come forward and
