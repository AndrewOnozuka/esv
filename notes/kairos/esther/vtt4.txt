great prayer for them okay and I see Dr Paul hey what's up good to see you um so we we're in our H Book of Esther series uh if I can just kind of recap quickly first chapter we met uh Queen vashi and she really stood up to the king because of her dignity to preserve the dignity and then she paid for it and she lost her throne um in the second chapter we were introduced to hadasa that's the Hebrew name for Esther Esther is the Persian name and we met someone that in a way as an orphan but God orchestrating things behind the scenes bringing her to that place of being the queen of Persia um seeing the hope that the Lord has for God's people even in Exile and then last week we talked about the conflict we talked about the bad guy in the story the antagonist okay we were introduced to hmon and hmon and the conflict that the just the hatred he has for the Jewish people goes Generations back and this not only is a hatred between the the people groups but it was a cosmic battle as well and we saw the enmity between God's people and God's plans and his desire to bring a redeemer and then the adversary Satan himself trying to thwart the plans of God so we met three characters today we're going to chapter 4 and it's the whole idea of moving towards compassion now I know there are a lot of young people here and so I'm generalizing and forgive me if I sound like I'm project ing myself onto you maybe you're really really good with compassion already somehow the way you're wired your temperament your experiences has welled up deep compassion in your heart is that some of you okay you don't have to raise your hands um 24 years old I was 24 so just a little bit older than you some a lot of you guys I was in my third year of Seminary taking my first counseling class I went into the finals thinking that counseling class it's not like Greek it's not Hebrew it's not Bible it's just counseling how hard can counseling be and so I hardly prepped for this final exam which was to be paired up with one of the classmates to bring up whether a madeup kind of madeup hypothetical situation or a a real life situation and then to council for 15 minutes right in front of the professor so I was like piece of cake what what what can I like f for him to put on instead of a sackcloth but he would not accept them then Esther summoned haak one of the king's unic assigned to attend her and ordered him to find out what was troubling morai and why why is morai morai is the um the cousin to hadasa to Esther that raised her the father figure and he's crying in the ash he covered with ashes and wearing a sackcloth he's crying at the at the gates the palace Gates and so she sends out the servant to find out why is he acting and behaving in such way and so in chapter 4 we learn that morai has learned about the edict he is a official of the palace he's working for the Kings so we can imagine the word is getting around when an edict is passed that 2 to 3 million Jews ought to be um killed on the last year last month of the year this is going to be the Talk of the Town and edicts have been written and issued and it's going all over the province of Persia the 127 um provinces of Persia and so morai naturally is probably one of the first to hear the news he's learned of it and as soon as he learns of the news of this edict he tears his clothes puts on a um sackcloth puts on ashes and he is just growling at the gate he is shouting he is Wailing he is crying at the gate he's trying to get into the palace but anyone who's dressed in such gar you cannot come in so he is right there um he cannot access his own place of employment so at the gate he is just crying out that's the scene that we see and then eventually Esther's Unix who are going in and out hear this man wailing and tells Esther this guy Mori outside there just weeping and wailing um we don't see this per se we see perhaps peaceful and sometimes a bit violent protests in our context we don't see a person weeping and wailing with sackcloth and Ashes but that was normal middle eastern culture when it came to expressing one's outrage over Injustice that was the way in which a person or the people group would be able to express their um anguish that they're experiencing they're about to be killed in a few months and the anguish and the pain the trepidation all the fear um in order to bring a protest against this edict that's what they're doing they're allowed to do this and in all of the provinces we see the people crying out for justice some Jews may have thought about fleeing Persia but where would they go because this covered all 127 provinces perhaps they thought we should have went back to Israel we should have gone back to Jerusalem with the first group to rebuild the city but even there this edict this law would have applied and so they had really nowhere else to go the only option left for them was to lament to cry out to gravel to wail as a protest now since they are Jewish people there was probably it doesn't say it in the text but probably there was also an element of praying to the Lord crying out to the Lord for salvation now what's interesting is and I think the author purposely is kind of painting the picture it was a situation but what he wants to highlight is there is one person who can deliver the Jews and that's Esther Esther is the one Jewish person that has access to the king's years who is inside the palace itself she's got the inside track but guess what she has no clue what's actually going on outside she has no clue what's actually happening and that there's an edict to eradicate all of her people within several months and I I think that irony that someone who is on the inside close to the king who issued this edict to kill off all the Jews is completely ignorant and those on the outside hmon knows exactly what's going on but is powerless to do anything about it I think that satire that irony here in chapter one chapter 4 is what we're paying attention to and outs Insider now it's not her fault per se Esther is shielded she is placed into a Herm and that's her position that's where she can be and she is typically you know these women are shielded from the the things that are going on outside the palace so that's the result of it but it's interesting because she is the Jew too and as the most powerful woman in all of Persia she's completely unaware of the cries of Injustice by her own people can you imagine can you imagine you having the key to a resolution can you imagine if you were the solution to the crisis at hand you are the only person that can bring resolution and yet you had no idea there was even a problem at all what problem what issue but that resource and answer lies with you and that's where we find Esther so the Unix come and tell Esther this morai outside the guy he raised uh Esther as her own da his own daughter so initially he send she sends out a fresh pair of clothing thinking maybe he's gone through some personal loss personal crisis maybe that's why he's crying out so if she wants him to change his outfit sends out a fresh pair of clothes but this crisis that morai understands is Way Beyond just a fresh new pair of clothes so he rejects it and he continues to gravel he continues to wail publicly and so she finally then takes the steps to send out one of our personal attendants hatak and says find out find out what's troubling morai and why I think there in lies the first movement towards growing in compassion I would say learning learn find out find out what's going on find out why why this is happening why is it that there's a whole group of people crying out for Injustice rather than sitting behind the walls and being ignorant learn what be the first posture that we can take as as the followers of Christ to find out what is going on and why there is so much protest are we Learners do we dig underneath the cries to find out what is going on and why that posture of learning is a posture of humility in my class in my final class I had the posture of preaching at the guy I had the pro posture of condemning him for such thoughts rather than taking on the posture of learning and why you know when George Floyd was killed um we held a small group Discussion Group um just as a kind of a response to talk with people in our church and I remember meeting outside it was the pandemic and um each of the staff we took kind of um particular lessons that we wanted to go over and really begin to see how as a church how are we to respond and um Esther or Esther had the the week about learning about the history of slavery and I remember she dug up some of these um chapter readings and she assigned it to our class and one of the chapters it's it's one of those things you you learn you read about and it's it just sticks with you you don't forget it you just cannot forget it and it changes you while she was doing research she dug up a chapter on lynching and how slaves were lynched during that time of slavery and it was graphic it was horrific I mean as we as a class Reddit together it just moved us I had never read anything like that before the posture of learning needs to be the posture of humility that we display if the Lord is going to move us towards compassion in addressing the things that the things that we want to tackle I think what Esther is showing us here and as an example is to find out what's going on and dig into why learn that's just I think the first step the second one we we see in the next sections verse six so hatak went out to morai in the open Square of the city in front of the king's gate and morai told him everything that had happened to him including even the exact amount of money hmon had promised to pay into the Royal treasury remember the 10,000 talents of silver because the the taxes were going to go away and the King needed to restore the taxes so hmon was going to plunder the Jews and bring money back into the king's treasury so hmon had promised to pay to the Royal treasury for the destruction of the Jews and he also gave him a copy of the text of the edict for their Annihilation which has been published in Susa and to show Esther and explain to her and he told him to instruct her to go into the king's presence to beg for mercy and plead with him for her PE people and so hadak went back and reported to Esther what morai had said um again just kind of pay attention to that satire she's on the inside but she has no idea what's going on hon who's act or Mori who's actually on the outside of the king's Palace knows very well to the detail of even Hon's um promise to pay back into the treasury he knows what's going on that's again the satire that we are paying attention to um remember how in the second chapter Mori had instructed Esther don't give away the fact that you're a Jew keep that concealed don't let the king find out because there was some anti-semitic sentiment among the Persians so keep that hidden as long as you keep that hidden you'll be fine in the king's Palace but now the things the crisis has escalated to the point where morai is telling Esther yeah let that cat out doesn't matter this is such um a crisis that you can no longer hide that fact of that you're a Jew you need to go into the king's quarters and you need to just cry out on behalf of the other Jews cry out for mercy and so we see that Esther is learning about what is going on the crisis that is at hand the Injustice that they're about to experience and now she is beginning the next posture of living listening she's beginning to listen listen to the appeals and listening to what morai is communicating to her through hatak but as she's listening she can't help but hesitate she can't help but to say wait a second okay now I'm learning what's going on but I also have something that's going on here as well so this hesitation comes the next passage verse 10 so she instructed um haak to say to morai just going back and forth you know all the king's officials and the people of the royal provinces know that for any man or woman who approaches the king in the inner Court without being summoned the King has but one law but everyone knows this okay she's she's kind of repeating the verbage of the law that just everyone knows about the whole all of Persia morai was would know about this so she she's starting there um and that they be put to death unless the king extends the gold scepter to them and Spares their lives okay so she's basically stated something that you know Mori all of the Jews anybody would have known you come without being summoned by the king death penalty in fact they they say that somebody would be there with um a sword or an Axe and if you approach the king and the King didn't like just put out the scepter then you would be killed immedi imately that was the law of the land but this part morai didn't know about so here's the ignorance that morai had morai had no idea but for 30 days have passed 30 days have passed since I was called to go to the king so he's now informing Mori it's been 30 days the king hasn't asked me to come into his court or to his chamber and remember how beautiful Esther was it was his beauty that just really mesmerized King xeri he desired her she was pleasing to him and we know there's some sexual connotation there but for 30 days now nothing and so in Esther's mind know I get what's going on outside I see there's a crisis at hand this is Injustice I'm in this position on The Insider I've been informed I've listen I I've learned but I as I'm listening oh it's been it's been a while it's been 30 days not sure what's going on in the king's mind but I'm not sure if I'm in favor with him and should I approach the courtroom I don't know what's going to happen to me to me and I think there's a hesitation that you sense in Esther's voice you at least be sympathetic with where Esther's at knowing now her life her very own neck is at risk here so she's listening she's learning she's listening but she's also in ttention because she values her life we get to verse 12 and when Esther's words were reported to morai he sent back this answer and here I I think there's a prophetic voice of God that morai probably he has no idea what he's saying but I I think there's a prophetic message here for all of us so he sends back this answer do not think that because you're a you're in the King's house you alone of all the Jews will escape so he makes the first appeal that's the first appeal don't think that you're going to be the only Jew that survives just because you happen to be in the king's Palace this applies to you too second appeal is for if you remain silent at this time relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place you might keep silent just to save your neck but the work of God salvation will come from someone somewhere else someone else but you and your father's family will perish and then the last appeal is who knows but that you have come to your Royal position for such a time as this if you kind of grew up in Sunday school or you've read through the Book of Esther before this is that famous phrase for such a time as this this moment this crisis that we're in the phrase that I hear from podcast and titles this cultural moment what is it that we're facing what is it that the church is facing this cultural moment for a Time such as this may not be as that traumatic but for us some of us it may be as individuals as we're sitting with someone you're in that moment in which God wants to use you to accomplish his purposes but anyway morai appeals to three different reasons and we see again the posture of Esther even though she wants to save her neck is still to listen she's learned and now she's continuing to listen in this dialogue and ignorance was what she came in with she was ignorant of about what was going on and now the ignorance is being dispelled and her heart is being minister to as these appeals are being made and she is listening to The Plea of morai and in it I think I see three things three ways to perhaps title those reasons one is identity morai appeals to her her identity you're a Jew of all the people groups in all of Persia you yourself are a Jew and don't think that you're going to be the only Jew that will survive because you'll be killed too he appeals to her identity secondly missed opportunity don't miss out on the opportunity to bring Salvation to your people because if you miss out on this opportunity guess what Esther God will raise up some other source someone else some other way some other means to to accomplish his will in this great Cosmic Battle of chapter 3 that we looked at someone else will accomplish it and I know some of us are like oh good let someone else do the work that's the temptation but sometimes you're there in that spot to accomplish God's work in that moment and that's the third moment the third thing you are in that position and in her case she had Royal status she had Royal position she had access to the king's years to be able to avert the crisis now we may not come to that kind of a moment as individuals perhaps you might as a church um I think we can really consider and think about what is going on in our culture what is happening what is the great outcry that we need to listen to We need to learn about and really listen why are we listening because listening is an act of love but listening also helps us to discern the invitation of God into his work if we're going in just with our Bible verses or with our resolutions and solutions because we think we know everything I think that's self-righteousness to learn to find out why to listen to the appeals that are ma being made is the posture that we need to grow in compassion and after listening it leads to this final section then Esther sent this reply to morai so she's listened and so she has final words to morai go gather together all the Jews who are in Susa and fast for me do not eat or drink for three days night or day I in my attent attendants will fast as you do and when this is done I'll go to the king even though it is against the law so when this is done after the three days of fasting I will go even at the risk of my own life I will go to the king and again the famous lines of Book of Esther if I perish I perish if I die I die so be it it's not being fatalistic this is that Daniel moment for her we talked about the Daniel moment we compared her to Daniel and her his friends where they Rose to the occasion but this is that moment for Esther if I perish I perish so morai went away and carried out all of Esther's instructions now chapters 5 six we're going to find out how this car gets carried out what Esther does as she enters into the king's um courts but this is the third part of growing in compassion we've learned now we've listened to the appeals and if I just stick with the L's okay lament lamenting fasting she's fasting she's participating with her fellow Jews but lamenting she also is joining in the outcry with her people for three days without food and water to learn to listen and finally arrive at a place where we can lament lamenting is not in my opinion in my own experience it's not easy I think what helps is when you can identify with your own Brokenness with your own sinfulness the capacity to Lament with others begins to crack I I hope this isn't in poor taste in terms of joking and I hope you can hear the subtleties but had I been in that class that counseling class today and that student is Express expressing to me just the Troubles of marriage and how he desires to leave that marriage I would say my wife would understand understand okay thank you I would say I understand again our marriage is good right Jess but I understand I feel where you're at I know what it's like this is um summary line from a NIV commentary you know when you come upon the marginalized and the vulnerable until there is solidarity excuses will always be found to avoid any involvement in Risk when I read that I was like oh oh just yeah just going to leave that there for a moment when you come upon the marginalized and vulnerable and if we're not entering that place with little superficial Bible verses and nothing against Bible verses just resolutions that want them to be happy get over things just overcome it all P these sayings that really doesn't do anything until there is actually solidarity excuses will always be found to avoid engagement I can come up with so many excuses and I can ask for all the excuses from all of us and we can probably compile a list of excuses what Esther chapter 4 tells us is perhaps we're not learning perhaps we're not listening perhaps we're not learning how to Lament well to join with those who are actually hurting and maybe individuals and maybe people you know around you have gone through a tough season it may be people communities that have gone through historically painful painful generations and I don't want us to be people full of excuses or reasons because we fail to listen to learn to lament with those who have been in so much pain have there's few applications that we can just consider and think about and I lead with that quote up there an open ear is the only believable sign of an open heart one can see the open heart but you can sense one's open heart when you experience an open year and rather than giving really shallow superficial answers for hoping for resolution if one gives an answer before he hears it is his folly and his shame and so again we lead with listen learning and listening and lamenting and those are the applications let's try to stop make excuses es let's recognize that things that stand in our way are actually excuses never stop learning in this age of information I I don't think we have an excuse that we we can't find out listen Incarnation and I borrow that title from the emotionally healthy spirituality book that we're using with our leaders listening Incarnation not just listening to the words but really listening to what's going on behind those words and finally slowing down and through the Holy Spirit who knows how to grieve that we've often grieved ourselves the Holy Spirit learning to grieve alongside of the Holy Spirit I think that then lines up the process or the pathway for us to grow in compassion to be able to bring the best news the good news of Jesus Christ and have the credibility to be able to share that as the best hope you know I go back to mori's I think prophetic words which is identity missed opportunity and the position of privilege and put ourselves in that place our identity as God's people our identity as Sons and Daughters of God who have who's been given the gospel the good news the best chance right but some of us perhaps we are the Esters shielded from what is really going on outside in people's hearts to break out of that where God calls us because our identity Esther was a Jew our identity are Sons and Daughters of God taking the opportunities that God gives us whether it's to stand with individuals sit with individuals or on behalf of people collectively not missing out on the opportunities the call of God to follow him is also to join him in his mission to pursue the work that he's called us to do so not hoping someone else will carry the responsibility but taking it as a joyful invitation and then the last thing is we have been given incredible privilege both Earthly resources as well as spiritual resources to be able to utilize that not for tokenism not for shallow sympathy but to truly care and we model this after our Lord Jesus Christ and I wrap up with this passage it's from the message version we typically use NIV here but I thought the message version by Eugene Peterson captures This Heart of the gospel and communicates that well for us today Philippians 2: 5-8 think of yourselves the way Christ Jesus thought of himself he had equal status with God but didn't think so much of himself that he had to cling to the advantage of the status no matter what not at all when the time came he set aside the privilege of deity and took on the status of a slave became human and having become human he stayed human and it was an incredible humbling process he didn't claim special privileges instead he lived a selfless obedient life and then died a selfless obedient death and the worst kind of death at that a crucifixion I hope those words um ministers to us shapes us knowing that our identity is in the Lord Jesus and we are God's people and the Lord because he loves the people especially the broken people or those who face who are going through injustices invite us and gives us wonderful opportunities to be able to minister lastly we have been given all the riches in Christ the resources the spirit empowers us to be Ministers of the Gospel Esther was the best chance and the Lord had directed her steps into the palace we're going to see that in chapters five and six she was the best chance at the Redemption of God's people the church today the Believers sometimes as individuals times as a collective whole we are the best chance we're all all the Brokenness let's learn let's listen let's learn to lament and sit with those who are in pain amen amen worship team would you come forward and um who's praying for the offering oh Agnes
