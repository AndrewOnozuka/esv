## Sermon Information
- **Date:** June 5, 2022
- **Church:** Kairos Christian Church
- **Speaker:** Pastor Peter Yoon
- **Title:** Everyone Needs a Thorn

## Historical Context
- Esther 6 follows the events of Haman’s plan to execute Mordecai (Esther 5:14).
- The Persian Empire was known for rewarding loyalty, but Mordecai’s act of saving the king had gone unnoticed for years (Esther 2:21-23).
- King Xerxes’ inability to sleep leads to a pivotal moment in the narrative where events begin to turn against Haman.
- This chapter highlights how a series of 'coincidences' align, pointing to divine orchestration rather than mere chance.
- Haman seeks permission to execute Mordecai just as the king is considering how to honor him, creating an ironic and dramatic reversal.

## Summary of Chapter 6
- King Xerxes, unable to sleep, orders the book of The Chronicles to be read to him (Esther 6:1).
- He discovers that Mordecai had exposed a plot against his life but had never been rewarded (Esther 6:2-3).
- At that very moment, Haman arrives to ask for Mordecai’s execution, but before he can speak, the king asks him how to honor someone deserving of recognition (Esther 6:4-6).
- Haman, assuming the king is referring to him, suggests extravagant honors, including wearing the king’s robe and being paraded through the streets on the king’s horse (Esther 6:7-9).
- The king then commands Haman to do exactly as he suggested—but for Mordecai (Esther 6:10-11).
- Humiliated, Haman returns home in mourning, only to be warned by his wife and advisors that his downfall is imminent (Esther 6:12-13).
- Before he can react, Haman is summoned to Esther’s second banquet, where his fate will be sealed (Esther 6:14).

## Key Themes & Lessons

1. **The Great Reversal**
   - The rise of Mordecai happens at the same time as the fall of Haman.
   - This moment marks a turning point in the narrative, where divine justice becomes evident (Proverbs 21:1, Psalm 75:6-7).
   - Even Haman’s wife and friends recognize that he is doomed, further emphasizing the divine hand at work.

2. **Pride Precedes Destruction**
   - Haman’s assumption that the king intended to honor him reveals his unchecked pride (Proverbs 16:18).
   - His humiliation serves as a warning against arrogance and self-importance (James 4:6).
   - When we are driven by self-glorification, we become blind to reality and vulnerable to downfall.

3. **The Thorn of Humility**
   - Just as Paul spoke of a “thorn in the flesh” to keep him from being conceited (2 Corinthians 12:7-10), Haman’s downfall teaches the necessity of humility.
   - In a culture that praises strength and success, we must be cautious not to become conceited.
   - God often allows weaknesses or challenges to remind us to depend on His grace rather than our own strength.

4. **God’s Sovereign Reversals**
   - The unseen hand of God orchestrates events in ways beyond human control (Proverbs 21:1).
   - What appears to be coincidence — King Xerxes’ insomnia — demonstrates divine providence at work (Romans 8:28).
   - Mordecai’s faithful service had gone unnoticed for years, but God ensured it was remembered at the perfect time.

## Connection to Modern Life
- The world often rewards self-promotion, but scripture teaches that humility leads to true exaltation.
- Like Haman, unchecked pride can blind us to reality, leading to our own downfall.
- When faced with opposition, believers can trust in God’s timing and justice rather than seeking revenge (Romans 12:19).
- Even setbacks and trials can be God’s way of preparing us for greater purposes.
- The ‘thorn’ in our lives—whether failure, hardship, or weakness—can be God’s tool to refine us and draw us closer to Him.

## Discussion Questions
- Can you name a time when you expected recognition but it was given to someone else?
- Where do you find yourself susceptible to pride, arrogance, spiritual superiority, conceit, or self-sufficiency?
- When was the last time you were so blinded by your own anger, ego, or pride that you completely missed what God was doing?
- What thorn in your side has humbled you to see your need for God’s grace?
- In what ways do you need to acknowledge your weakness and come to God to receive the abundance of grace He has for you?

## Looking Ahead
- The tension between Esther and Haman reaches its climax in the next chapter.
- Haman’s fate is sealed as his own schemes backfire spectacularly.

---

Esther 6 is a turning point in the book, reminding us that while pride leads to destruction, humility and trust in God lead to true honor. God is always working behind the scenes to bring justice in His perfect timing. The ‘thorn’ of humility is necessary to keep us grounded and reliant on His grace, rather than on our own self-righteousness or strength.
