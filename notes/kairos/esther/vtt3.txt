is sort of a it's not even a survey it's more of a question but college students um because um traditionally you go home for the summer and come back in the fall can I see just a raise of hands you know you'll be staying because you're taking either first um session for summer or second session can I just see a raise of hand if you know you will be here in the summer just raise them up high I I'm asking because we got to figure out if we're going to be running two services or one service during summer okay what do you think Pastor Phil okay thank you um we'll probably do some communication prior to uh mid June to kind of get a feel for the numbers because that will let us know um just even before up until the pandemic the numbers were where we were able to do one service in the summer months um but we're like right in between that stage okay all right and then the basketball I look forward to the fellowship Paul I heard you did like metrics and you really like evaluated People based on shooting rebounding and passing and all that other stuff there incredible amount of details you put into that I I want to ask you where you ranked me but you can tell me that later okay I you don't need to say that publicly anyway um just some people are visiting for the first time welcome welcome to kyos church we hope this time will be meaningful we've been on the Book of Esther series and so uh we did chapter one where we talked about Queen vashi um upholding her dignity that began off the story of Esther and then we got to chapter two where we saw hadasa um Hebrew name for Esther and we saw her as the Myrtle tree the tree that can be uprooted and planted elsewhere even in desert-like condition but it still has strong roots and continues to grow and that's where we find the the Jewish Exile uprooted from their Temple uprooted from Jerusalem from their home and just disperse all around prent grounds but they're continuing to see the work of God in their lives and so we come to chapter three where we meet the bad guy okay the conflict every story if you're going to be engaged and engross needs a conflict a conflict produces the kind of heightened emotions the search for resolution the one that the viewer or the reader engages in and here is a picture of conflict are these guys here are you guys here I took this picture on Easter Sunday picnic man this is what some of our guys were doing yeah first service they're like who are those guys but I figured you guys would enjoy this one more um this is just this was a friendly bentor and I was wow like we need to start some MMA Ministry just kidding just totally kidding okay um conflict and so chapter 3 introduces us to uh hmon and he's the one that is the antagonist that will come and as we follow the story of Esther we will see a great enmity between hmon and we'll see in today's chapter Mori and we see a story that's going on between two characters but if we can see with our spiritual eyes there's more to it then meets the eye and so we're going to take a look at chapter 3 asking the Lord to open our spiritual eyes as well as our natural eyes to the story you know the story of God the story of the Bible the 66 books that are unique and have been canonized tells one unified story of Jesus Christ the Messiah who redeems us from creation to the fall to the story of Israel then Jesus Christ the Messiah the church and the final consummation it's one unified story that really points to one savior one Lord the central protagonist which is Jesus Christ and like I said every story needs a good conflict a good Nemesis who do you think is this nemesis of the grand story of the Bible Satan he is introduced early on in Genesis leads Adam and Eve to the great fall and since then sin has re havoc and destroyed people lives Nations communities friendships just what have you and Jesus Christ is the only solution to this Grand Story and this Cosmic battle is one that still goes on now we Western educated living in a western Society we don't typically think about the spiritual battle that goes on if you're in certain kind of pockets of churches where it tends to be a little bit more we use the word charismatic um there the spiritual battle talk the language the framework is a little bit more prevalent a church here where many of you grew up in churches probably not in that type of background um this may seem a little bit hokey weird you don't really have um the language even for it but this is important I mention this because this serves also as the backdrop to the conflict that we'll see between morai and hmon okay and as we look at that just kind of have that point of view in mind try not to be so Western is is the request this this morning okay so let's read okay this one yeah that's just fun just sport um chapter three after these events King xeres honored hmon the son of hamadaa the agagite you know what an agagite is okay and it's okay if you don't we're going to unpack the word agagite um elevating him and giving him a seed of Honor higher than that of all the other Nobles and all the Royal officials at the king's gate knelt down and paid honor to hmon for the king had commanded this concerning him but morai would not kneel down or pay him honor morai is the cousin cousin of hadasa of Esther raised him raised her up um in verse three then the Royal officials of the king's gate asked morai why do you disobey the King's Command day after day they spoke to him but he refused to comply therefore they told hmon about it whether to see mori's behaviors would be tolerated for he had told them he was a Jew when hmon saw the Mori when hmon saw that morai would not kneel down or pay him honor he was enraged yet Having learned who mori's people people were he scorned the idea of killing only morai instead hmon looked for a way to destroy all mori's people genocide complete eradication of all Jews the Jews threw out the whole Kingdom of xeres okay so we got this man who's been promoted his name is hmon um it's been about 5 years after Queen Queen Esther has been given the throne and about 5 years in for unknown reason hmon is elevated to this status right next to the king he's got supreme power only the king can change his mind he's been given this position and we may see it as just some opportunity that came up for hmon just some um administrative promotion but all again keep in mind the Book of Esther God is orchestrating things and also there's the backdrop of a spiritual battle that is going on in The Invisible realm so hmon is known as an agagite and since none of us probably know what an agagite is we need to unpack that a bit so we're going to go into Israel's history the agagites history and see that that phrase his identity as an agite really paints a picture of a conflict between the Jews and a group of people called the amalekites um every protagonist in the stories the movies that we you know watch we entertained by they have this Archen enemy so if I say Superman who's the Archen enemy of Superman yeah that would be my first guest Lex Luther he's had other Nemesis but Lex Luther is the Archen enemy of Superman um if I say uh Harry Potter okay Voldemort Lord Voldemort he's had other conflicts other characters but Lord Voldemort is the vile character okay no one got this right in the first service but Princess Aurora the Sleeping Beauty okay this generation got it I'm just kidding but myf isent okay and that makes and look a little bit kind of endearing and cute maybe these days but hmon the agagite there was nothing wonderful about this person and the kind of conflict that they were experiencing um you know I enjoy watching K drama and I've shared this before I know when I share that I I feel like I'm being a little bit judged like Pastor watches K drama like what kind of sinful behavior is that so I I better be careful what I admit before you but there was this onek drama where wow the antagonist I couldn't wait to see the antagonist just get it stick it to that person right it was called venzo okay some of you saw that okay let's not give it away okay and all K dramas end up happy the the resolution is that the bad guy loses but man that one I was like oo they just get so under my skin did you feel that way about the antagonist those who said o like as if you saw it okay anyway anyway if you didn't see it it's okay don't watch K drama it's sin okay so then agagite is a is is this a term that comes from King a AAG okay and King AAG is part of the amalekites now what's an amalekite tribal nomadic people group and we're first introduced to the amalekites in Exodus chapter 17 okay in Exodus chapter 17 the Israelites had just gotten out of Egypt Moses is leading them out they had crossed the Red Sea for about 3 days they made it out into the desert condition they naturally get thirsty and they're in Mara and there the Lord provides water miraculously for them and about two months in into this whole Trek into the promised land through the desert they get hungry I think that they ran out of food by then the food that they had brought with them from that trip out of Egypt they run out of food they're so they're starting to Grumble so the Lord's Give the Lord provides mana and quail and they're satisfied so this is kind of the pattern going on immediately recognize hey we got to go up there help out the old man and so they prop up his arms on both sides and they hold it up for him and as long as moses' hands are up by the end of the day today the Israelites miraculously with no military training defeat the amalak sites who tried their best to plunder to destroy to kill women children just all of Israelites have you ever gotten into a fight okay you don't have to raise your hands you you don't have to identify yourself lots of pacifist here okay have you ever gotten into like like a real fist fight I'm not talking about verbal assault or that deadly stare okay but a real scuffle where there's you know fists being thrown some of you are smiling I don't know if that's an indication that yeah I have and I'm replaying that moment in my life okay because you won if you didn't win oh painful um my my son had I I wouldn't call it a fight but just a scuffle scuffle back in fourth grade wasn't it fourth grade somebody attacked him misunderstood him attacked him he just tried to defend himself they ended up in a headlock fell to the ground couple of his buddies came and threw off the guy and then they were in the office by then nothing that was it it was very shortlived but I asked him do you remember that day still he was like oh yeah I remember yeah I can't forget that day his first ever the only one the only one I remember picking him up at the nurse's office and he was just you know weeping and crying that's not what he wanted to do but he remembers I even asked him today because it's part of the sermon I go do you remember that day you fought he goes oh yeah I remember I I would imagine you remember that first fist fight the first physical assault okay I don't know if you remember the first deadly stare or the verbal assault you may have lashed out at other people but people remember that Conflict at least in the world that we typically live in this was the first fist fight if you will of Israel just trying to travel get through the land and get to their destiny nation and the amalekites come and picking a fight the first fight against Israel people had no background in fighting whatsoever they remember this fight but not only do they remember this fight God wanted them to remember this fight God made sure they would never forget the people of amalec he records there in Exodus chapter 17 the Lord said to Moses after the whole battle write this on a scroll isn't that interesting this is the first thing that actually gets it's written on their Journey this is before the tablets this is before the Ten Commandments he tells Moses write this down as something to be remembered I don't want you to forget this guys and make sure that Joshua the the commander the next guy in charge he's it because I will completely blot out the name of amalec from under the heaven and what they did to Israel going to just blot that people group out and Moses built an altar and this is the first altar that is actually established an altar for worship remembering the Lord Moses built an altar and called it the Lord is my banner and he said because the hands were lifted up against the Throne of the Lord I think that's key this fight wasn't just kind of a fight between a tribal nomadic group called The amalekites and this Jewish these guys who were just trying to cross the land it was a fight where the hands were lifted up against the Lord himself it was rebellion in the Heavenly Realms the Lord will be at war against the amalekites from generation to Generation Now do you see why I shared at the beginning there's a backdrop there's an invisible battle that is going on more than meets the eye hmon the agite was an amalekite this fight started centuries ago later on as the um the book of Deuteronomy is being read to the Israelites chapter 25 the Lord says remember what the amalekites did to you along the way when you came out of Egypt it really he doesn't God doesn't want the Israelites to forget this I I want my son not to remember that scuffle back in fourth grade I want him to be a pie loving child but the Lord is saying remember this fight when you were weary you're worn out they met you on your journey and attacked all those who are lagging behind right and who lags behind on these long Journeys there are no fear of God when the Lord your God gives you rest from all the enemies around you in the land he is giving to you to possess as an inheritance you shall after that you shall BL blot out the name of amalec from under Heaven don't forget do not forget this so again not only do they psychologically remember that first fight of the forefathers the Lord reminds them not to forget that fight the amalekites attacking the Israelites the young the vulnerable the old as they were making that track to promised land so now the Israelites you know history is passing the Book of Judges is going on and even in the Book of Judges if you follow kind of the history of amalekites about six more times they show up and they attack Israel Time and Time and Time Again plundering Israel attacking their supplies killing their um tribes their their Villages finally that comes Israel arrives to that place of monarchy they have a king they now reside in in the southern part of Judah they're building a city they're training military people they're beginning to establish their society as a people group and so God finally comes then to the first king you remember the first king's name of Israel King Saul and his word is about to be fulfilled he tells Samuel this is what the Lord Almighty says I will now punish the amalekites for what they did to Israel when they waylay them as they came up from Egypt now go he's telling King Saul and the isites now go attack the amalekites and totally destroy all that belongs to them do not spare them put to death men women children infants cattle sheep camel donkeys just complete eradication of any people group called The amalekites now we've talked about violence in the Old Testament a bit in the past so I'm just going to kind of gloss over that I know just kind of processing that is questionable in our generation but um we're going to look at this just from the Old Testament times and Old Testament context so he's going out and telling the King Saul now you have soldiers now you're ready for battle go go do your business let the word of God be fulfilled let's destroy all of amalec now in that story as we follow along did King sa obey no he kind of half obeyed they did go into battle defeat the am malachite armies but then he saw all the camel sheep all the plunder he said this is good stuff why would the Lord want us to destroy this thing in fact we could even use it as like offering to our God he would be so pleased with the choice lamb and the cattle these amalekites have hoarded and have kept for themselves so Saul decides to take the mission in his own schematics in his own wisdom says okay you know what don't kill everything don't kill everyone in fact even the king AEK spare his life so he spares the King's life he keeps a lot of the plunder and he's just saying yeah this is what I decided to do this is my decree and this is when he loses favor with God Samuel comes and says God your God is so God regrets the day he made you King so again I I'm sharing all this just to provide the background of hmon the agagite and that this Feud this EMB bitterness this en it has been going on for Generations since Exodus 17 and again that phrase because the hands were lifted up against the Throne of the Lord and that helps us to connect the spiritual realm this is not just hey we don't like you guys running across our front lwn we're just going to attack you and the weak and the old we're going to kill you that's what we're seeing visually but in the Heavenly realm this is an affront an attack against the Lord his purposes his plans later on there's actually a prophetic word in the book of numbers that is spoken about the amalekites and they get the title first among the nation the chief among the Nations the amalekites they were the arch enemies at that time of Israel there was no people group um that they hated even just so much um I I want to interject this passage it's from New Testament and it covers again the biblical Paradigm biblical worldview in this short passage that Paul is writing he says you know for our struggle is not against flesh and blood but against the ruler against the authorities against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the Heavenly realms for us westerners that's hard to discern it's a it sounds a little bit out there made for a movie but this is the biblical world view and our conflict that we experience the spiritual battle spiritual warfare is the language we use there's also this stuff happening in The invis Invisible realm and for the Israelites and the amalekites there was a huge spiritual battle that was going on and the amalekites in a sense were the forces of Darkness Satan the enemy of God wanting to thwart eliminate the plan of God what was the plan of God the plan of God was that through the seed of Abra seed of a woman first with the Seed of Abraham would come forth a nation that nation was his people through whom the line of Messiah savior of the world would come through this now I I don't know how you feel about Jewish people or the Israelites or this kind of geopolitical stuff but biblically speaking they were the chosen people and God decided to use Abraham so that Earthly fleshly savior would be born into this world who would ultimately take the sins of the entire world God had a master plan well guess who hated that Master Plan amalekites yes but if you look into the Heavenly Realms the one that raises the hand against the Lord the enemy the adversary Satan hates that plan why because he hates you you know why he hates you like what do we do we're just born because we carry the image of God every single creature born we carry God's image and when Satan sees you guess what he sees he sees the image of the one he rebelled against and loathed and despises he hates you and Satan hated the Israelites and Through the Dark Forces mysteriously working the amalekites wanted to completely destroy the plan of God it's really interesting because Saul was to kind of do the reversal and eliminate the enemy of God the amalekites but he fails to do so he decides ah King AOG he doesn't seem that bad of a guy we'll just let him live we'll keep all the plunder and so generation after generation the war keeps waging between amalec and Israel he left it to Fester he left the conflict to fester for Generations morai was not only a Jew but he was from The Tribe of Benjamin do you know who else was from The Tribe of Benjamin King Saul do you know mori's ancestor was also from the line of Kish do you know who who Kish is King Saul's dad so isn't it interesting the connection that this isn't just some coincidence that God knows that when he gave King Saul the first opportunity to eradicate the enemies of God trying to thwart God's Redemptive plans King Saul said nah I got some I got better ideas and just allow it left it to Fester but he's saying you know I'm faithful God is faithful to the line of K to The Tribe of Benjamin and this time around morai from that same lineage thousand years later will be used to accomplish God's War battle against the enemy God is faithful even if Generations upon Generations we've Our Heritage our families have invited sin or allow things to fester in our lives God is faithful in this generation ation and desires to cut off any curses that may be lingering God is faithful to us um The Story Goes On where like hmon is so angry he doesn't want to just kill hmon that's not enough I'll just kill this guy no wonder hmon I'm sorry no wonder morai no wonder morai doesn't bow to hmon this has been an ageold Feud for so long he says I'll never bow to that man neite am malachite he is so enraged I mean you go from like dark to darker like evil to more evil he's saying just killing Mori is enough I will kill your entire race okay when when when you're filled with rage to that point and now you have supreme power to enact that there's something demonic so evil so dark going on um and it's interesting when we look at what he does next he casts Lots okay so let's read that part where he casts Lots he's diving deeper into the realm of the Demonic forces now in the 12th year King xerses in the first month the month of Nissan the purr that is the lot was cast in the presence of hmon to select a day and a month he's trying to figure out when do I kill all these Jews so they're casting a lot and the lot fell on the 12th month the month of Adar then hmon said to King xeres there's a certain people dispersed among the people in all the provinces of your kingdom who keep themselves separate their Customs are different from those of all the other people they do not obey the king's laws it is not in the king's best interest to tolerate them and if it pleases a king let a decree be issued to destroy them and I will give 10,000 talents of silver to the king's administrators for the Royal treasury he's making a deal with the the king here right so the king took his Signet ring from his finger and gave it to hmon the son of hameda the agagite the enemy of the Jews the king says Hey keep the money the king said to hmon and there's something like um like shame honor culture he needs the money King xers lost a lot of money fighting against the Greeks so you know when like sometimes I don't know happens in the shame and honor culture yeah keep it but they really are saying no no no give it to me that kind of double meaning that's what's going on here keep the money the king said to heon but this one and do with the people as you please you want to eradicate them you want to kill off two to three million Jews that are dispersed through the Persian Empire go ahead here's my ring that gives you ultimate Authority supreme power go for it now the casting of the Lots is what's int intriguing you know we think of casting of the Lots like throwing a dice and it's like who lucky you know and we kind of see it from a western non-spiritual there's no meaning in it other than maybe luck of the dice luck of the rooll type of a thing but this is actually sorcery in the Persian practice the casting lotes s sorcery witchcraft divination this is actually interacting with the Demonic and he is trying to figure out when is the best time the most opportune time when we can attack the Israelites completely eliminate the plan of God One Pastor said about this this is the idea of receiving demonic permission and guidance for the mass killing so this throwing the Lots this casting the lot wasn't just like hey let's just do it for fun and then we'll decide what day to kill the Israelites it really was giving this act of mass murder Mass killing to the Demonic realm okay try your best to try to listen to this as you know non-westerners and kind of get engaged in the story that way try your best to do that hmon had another reason for casting the lots and one commentary explains it as like you know he's seen the the Vicious Cycle of the Israelites like they obey God they're pleasing to him there's favor they disobey God they follow Idols they commit to all kind of injustices and then there's punishment it's this vicious cycle God raises a Jud Jud and brings them out they repent so that vicious cycle is going back and forth and in Hon's eyes he knows that they're right about to get back to the that favor again they've been in exile for over a hundred years they've been in that punishment phase of the Vicious Cycle and he sees a golden opportunity here and so he's really trying to figure out what day is it that the the forces of Darkness can be completely Unleashed on the Israelites eradicating them because right now God is not happy with them that's why their um Temple has been destroyed they've been taken as Exiles and so he recognizes I got to get that right time they're on timeout in a way they're on timeout and while they're timeout it's like this is a good time to get them so that's why he throws the cast to the lot looking for that day and it just so happens the lot leads them to about 11 months later the month of Adar the lot Falls says okay on the month of Adar go for it kill every Jew kill every Israelite you know plunder them just that's what's happening so let's look at the next um part of this then on the 13th day of the first month of the um the then on the 13th day of the first month the Royal secretaries were summoned they wrote out in the script of each province and in the language of of each people all of Hon's orders to the king satraps the governors of the various provinces and the Nobles of various people they were written in the name of King xeres himself and sealed with his own ring and dispatches were sent by couriers to all the king's provinces with the order to destroy to kill and annihilate all the Jews young and old women and children on a single day the 13th day of the 12th month the month of Adar and to plunder to plunder their goods so this law is written now a copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every Province lots of language languages being spoken and and made known to the people of every nationality so that they would be ready for that day the couriers went out spurred on on by the King's Command and the edict was issued in the Citadel of Susa so the edict was on that 13th day you're not you don't just have permission to plunder and kill you're commanded to plunder and kill the king and hmon sat down to drink they've come up with a wonderful plan they've checked in with casting of the Lots they knew all the forces were for them so there they just chilling having a nice drink but the city of Susa was bewildered the whole city just went in an uproar um somebody in the first service was telling me there's there's some movie like and then on one day out of the year you're supposed to go around just killing people what's that movie called a perge okay I I've never seen it did you just watch it okay is is that the premise I just I just can't imagine the psychology of like there's this day coming up and just go kill or be killed I guess that's it's just wild to me anyway maybe they read Esther um so you you have to really imagine this this edict is going out historians say it would probably take about three months for the LW to be completely dispersed in all of you know all 127 provinces and the question is like why why would the lot why would the lot be cast you know 11 months later why not like a month later why not like ASAP um we don't know but one thing that extra biblical sources say when when the lot was cast by hmon and landed on the 12th month in the month of Adar he was so happy he rejoiced because he again saw the spiritual connection he said that lot um the lot has fallen for me hmon is speaking the lot has fallen for me on the month of Moses's death so he is saying you know that the curse or the hardship when Moses has died the people of the great leader of Israel that will be the month when the Israelites will be completely eradicated now he's just just relaxing waiting for that month to come um what's unique is not so much the month Adar but it's actually the day that the edict is written down starting to be dispersed that's the 13th day of the first month and all the commentaries they note the coincidence that this law is being written down on the 13th day of the month one do you know what the 14th day of month one is for the Jewish calendar do you have any Jewish friends or anybody the 14th day of month one is the first day of the great Passover Festival right you're like okay Passover I've heard of that that's the whole Egyptian um plague but Passover if I had to kind of use the modern equivalence it would be akin to like our um independence day it will be the day that at least in United States they are just celebrating getting ready for that barbecue they have a day off they're celebrating this great Independence and it would be akin to that now some of you are like yeah Independence Day whatever they're all same days but you have to imagine hymon releasing this edict the day before Passover it almost seems strategic this will be the the most it'll be the last passover they ever celebrate and I just want to make sure that this year there Passover is a dud want to make sure that they there's no joy among the Israelites and he releases that the day before Passover day I was trying to imagine this and this brings me now to one of two applications okay the first application so for us the greatest day of celebration for the Christian church will be Easter correct right if you have another one that's not debate it's Easter okay so it's Easter and then your birthday okay it's Easter and then your baptism day um but Easter imagine if the law is passed in our land I'm just imagining okay just totally hyper hypothetical situation imagine on the day before Easter the church is getting ready we're ready to celebrate we got the picnic prepared we have all the games we're having um choirs and all that stuff that we've been putting into the effort but we find out between Good Friday and Easter on that Saturday a law passes that within months that all Church's properties will be confiscated completely conf confiscated all the church's employees will be arrested along with their family members any permit that had been given will be completely revoked bank accounts any funding left in the churches will be will also be confiscated and it'll be completely Frozen and for the rest of the folks anyone making the attempt to gather in the name of Jesus be met with the highest degree of punishment now I I can't even like I just wrote these things down as I was typing just to kind of try to um bring the modern equivalence but I can't even put myself in there because it's so ludicrous it's so hypothetical okay but imagine what e Sunday would feel like following if if this law was passed would you come to Easter Service that following day and if you came what would be the buzz what would be the talk what would be the conversation that everyone is talking about would it be like Jesus resurrected and it's amazing Hallelujah let's go find some eggs for the kids I would be like what are we going to do are we supposed to obey this law what's going to happen to you if you guys care about the pastor what's going to happen to you Pastor and your family there would be a level of bewilderment the confusion that Susa fell into at least to some degree but again as I kind of thought through this kind of did a thought exercise I really realized it's so ludicrous I can't even bring it to like my emotions and this is challenging I admit but I I I pray that the holy spirit will grab our hearts this is not hypothetical for some brothers and sisters in the world today this is real this is real in some Nations where churches are persecuted they want to go to Easter Service and celebrate the resurrection of Jesus in some it's political persecution and others it's flat out arrests sentencing I just you know looked it up and maybe you can too this would be my first just offer of application if you will look up persecuted churches in the world you can just Google it we get lots of lists Maps will come up and maybe this week um hopefully as you think about it maybe the Holy Spirit leads just pray for the people in that Nation it doesn't have to be long um if you want to dig a little bit more information so that it becomes like learning and grieving together like as we learn we grieve together we mourn together and we intercede that's one application that I offer just looking at what's going on in Esther's chapter Esther chapter 3 this is a dark dark day the Demonic forces are at work against our brothers and sisters as they're being heavily persecuted in their countries we in the west enjoying the freedom of religion the freedom to to gather where that world is really foreign even to me we can't even imagine it it's all hypothetical I pray that the Holy Spirit Will tug out our hearts to intercede so that's one application I just encourage you maybe this week you know you're doing stuff and you have a moment to pause just Google the persecuted churches in the world and pray for one nation okay the second application is Gear Up gear up for the fight this Cosmic battle that goes on that's behind the scenes of hmon and morai it touches us too just as God had a Redemptive plan and purpose for the people of Israel God has purpose for each and every one of you that God wants to carry out and you know who hates that you know who hates it down to the Core the adversary the enemy the evil spirits want nothing of that to come to fruition we'll throw everything at you including the kitchen sink to prevent God's purposes from coming to fruition the story of Esther goes on and we know the great reversal we'll get to that as we move on along the chapters of Esther we have all the confidence in the world that greater is he that is in me and he that is in the world we have that confidence the fight is real the Warfare is vicious and so no wonder Paul writes to the churches early on you got to gear up for the fight you got to put on some Spiritual armor you cannot just show up and think that you're going to survive this battle talks about the helmet the sword of the spirit that's the word of God the shield of Faith the belt of Truth the feet fitted with the gospel he talks about all of these things and and into another church that he's writing to he just says look you can't fight with the weapons this world gives you this world doesn't offer the kind of weapons that is adequate in battling against the war that is against the great enemy the adversary you need things like prayer and the word of God without them you're easy picking just as the Israelites were to the amalekites Gear Up Put on that Shield of faith and the lies are just come just aimed at you the darts the fiery darts are aimed at you coming in all sorts of Direction ask the Lord God help me to have faith Give Me Faith G to Hoist the shield of faith and block those fiery lies there's so many lies aimed at us against us the word of God that's sitting in our phones or just sitting on our bedside pick it up you're having the worst day you're disoriented you're in despair you're being more divisive than ever before more easily agitated angered Pi up God's word begin to let the word of God minister to you protecting you this is spiritual battle if you want to Google another you know assignment in this application um you can Google what are the common signs of a spiritual warfare what are the common signs of spiritual attacks and just be careful there are some you know funky ones out there I don't know but I thought this came from a pretty good source um just all kinds of troubles just all of a sudden out of nowhere just hit you perhaps your family you're like what is going on my world just turned upside down it could be an indication that something spiritually is going on you're about to break through in your faith your family is growing doing well there's progress there's momentum and Bam Satan throws the kitchen sink at you completely disorients the members of the family pray in that situation there's a whole increased level of Temptations we're always tempted temptation is going to be part of what we face but there's an increased amount and the failure rate is just spiking and you can tell this is greater amount than maybe Norm it's hard to discern these things I I understand but if that's what's going on ask people for prayer for prayer support cover yourselves people who are feeling despair we get gloomy we get sad every now and then we have bad days we have good days we're talking about Despair and it's kind of a nagging thought it just stays with you your worthlessness hopelessness you just feel like life is no good sure you may have failed a test or didn't get the promotion and you're like ah that sucks and it lasts a little bit temporary we all get it but this one is really lingering much longer good therapy will help but also recognize there may be something going on behind the scenes confusion self- condemnation same thing and lastly divisiveness like for some reason like you leave a trail of broken relationships not only are you broken with the relationship but the people that you infected affected their relationships are broken too why because of your words your slander your gossip you just came in and they were actually pretty good roommates and friends and all of a sudden boom what just happened perhaps a level of spiritual warfare is festering year up GE up with the word of God with prayer with faith year up because this Cosmic battle that's the backdrop of hmon and morai it's the cosmic backdrop for us as well we may not like it we may not understand it all it may seem a little bit weird at times but that doesn't excuse us we are children of God engaged in this fight fight the Lord equips us to be Victorious and it reminds us again this encourage us not put fear I don't want you to be afraid or think everything is spiritual greater is he that is in me in us than he that is in the world and the story of Esther goes Esther wins okay I'm giving you the ending but
