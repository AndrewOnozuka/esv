# Esther 7

## Sermon Information
- **Date:** June 12, 2022
- **Church:** Kairos Christian Church
- **Speaker:** Pastor Peter Yoon
- **Title:** The Moment of Truth

## Historical Context
- Esther 7 marks the climax of the Book of Esther, where Queen Esther finally reveals her true identity and exposes Haman’s plot.
- King Xerxes and Haman attend the second banquet prepared by Esther, a strategic moment where she presents her plea.
- Persian banquets were known for heavy drinking, which played a role in the unfolding events (Esther 7:1-2).
- The Persian law permitted genocide as an official decree that could not be easily reversed, making Esther’s appeal critical (Esther 3:13).
- Haman had recently been humiliated in chapter 6, where instead of executing Mordecai, he was forced to honor him (Esther 6:10-12).
- The setting of the banquet in the harem holds symbolic significance, as harems were not only places of pleasure but also symbols of political power and alliance.

## Summary of Chapter 7
- Esther courageously reveals her Jewish identity and pleads for her life before King Xerxes (Esther 7:3-4).
- The king, shocked by the revelation, demands to know who is responsible for the plot (Esther 7:5).
- Esther boldly identifies Haman as the adversary and enemy behind the scheme (Esther 7:6).
- The king, enraged, steps out into the garden to process what he has just learned (Esther 7:7).
- Haman, realizing his fate is sealed, begs Esther for his life but, in a fateful moment, falls onto her couch just as the king returns (Esther 7:8).
- This action appears as an attempt to assault the queen, further enraging the king.
- A servant informs the king that Haman had built a gallows to execute Mordecai, leading to the swift decision to execute Haman on it instead (Esther 7:9-10).
- Haman, who sought to destroy others, is ultimately destroyed by his own scheme, marking the beginning of the Great Reversal.

## Key Themes & Lessons

1. **The Moment of Truth & Courage**
   - Esther seizes the perfect moment to reveal her identity, demonstrating wisdom and bravery (Esther 7:3-4).
   - She carefully crafts her words to appeal to the king’s emotions and sense of justice (Proverbs 16:23).
   - Courage often requires waiting for the right opportunity rather than rushing into action (Ecclesiastes 3:7).

2. **Divine Reversal & Justice**
   - Haman, who sought Mordecai’s destruction, meets his own demise on the same gallows (Proverbs 26:27).
   - The biblical principle that the wicked will fall into their own traps is evident (Psalm 7:15-16).
   - This great reversal is a reminder of God’s justice prevailing, even when it seems delayed (Romans 12:19).

3. **The Gospel Message in Esther**
   - The Great Reversal in Esther reflects the gospel message—where what seemed like imminent defeat is turned into salvation.
   - Just as Haman sought to destroy the Jews, Satan seeks to kill, steal, and destroy (John 10:10).
   - Through Christ’s life, death, and resurrection, we experience the ultimate reversal: from death to life, from condemnation to justification (Romans 3:23-24, Romans 5:10, Colossians 2:13-15).

4. **The Power of Influence & Advocacy**
   - Esther uses her position and influence for the good of her people (Proverbs 31:8-9).
   - She risks everything for the sake of justice, embodying the role of an intercessor (John 15:13).
   - Advocacy for the oppressed aligns with biblical principles of righteousness (Isaiah 1:17).

5. **Pride Leads to Destruction**
   - Haman’s arrogance blinds him to the reality of his downfall (Proverbs 16:18).
   - His desperation in the end highlights how unchecked ambition leads to ruin (Luke 14:11).
   - Just as he sought to destroy Mordecai and the Jews, he ultimately destroys himself.

## Connection to Modern Life
- Speaking up for justice requires wisdom, courage, and discernment.
- Divine justice is not always immediate but is inevitable.
- Using our influence for good is a responsibility, not just a privilege.
- The gospel reminds us that Christ’s sacrifice is the greatest reversal, where death was defeated and we were given new life (1 Corinthians 15:55-57).
- Pride and unchecked ambition can lead to one’s downfall if not tempered with humility.

## Discussion Questions
- Where and when in your life have you recognized God invisibly working behind the scenes? How did you realize God was doing something?
- How often do you reflect on the narrative of Jesus’ gospel? How do you tell that narrative?
- Have you ever experienced an ironic reversal in your own life where God turned a dire situation into something good?
- What does victory over the enemy mean to you in the context of your faith?

## Looking Ahead
- With Haman dead, the edict against the Jews remains in effect, requiring further action in chapter 8.
- Esther and Mordecai must now navigate the legal complexities to ensure the survival of their people.

Esther 7 teaches that courage, patience, and faith lead to divine justice. Haman’s downfall reminds us that wickedness will not prevail, and God’s unseen hand is always working to bring about justice in His perfect timing. The chapter serves as a powerful parallel to the gospel—the greatest reversal—where Christ’s victory secured salvation for His people.
