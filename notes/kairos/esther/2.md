## Sermon Information
- **Date:** May 8, 2022
- **Church:** Kairos Christian Church
- **Speaker:** Pastor Peter Yoon
- **Title:** A Myrtle Tree

## Historical Context
- Esther 2 occurs four years after the events of chapter 1.
- King Xerxes had failed in his military campaign against Greece and returns to focus on internal matters.
- A search for a new queen begins to replace Vashti, resulting in Esther’s selection.
- Esther and her cousin Mordecai are introduced; Mordecai is a Jew from the tribe of Benjamin, a descendant of Kish, linking him to King Saul (1 Samuel 9:1-2).
- Esther, also known as Hadassah, represents a bicultural identity as both a Jew and a Persian (Esther 2:7).
- The name Hadassah means “Myrtle tree,” which carries symbolic significance of resilience and righteousness (Isaiah 55:13, Zechariah 1:8).

## Summary of Chapter 2
- King Xerxes, following the advice of his attendants, searches for a new queen (Esther 2:2-4).
- Young women, including Esther, are taken into the royal harem for preparation before meeting the king (Esther 2:8).
- Esther undergoes 12 months of beauty treatments before her turn with Xerxes (Esther 2:12).
- She wins the king’s favor and is crowned queen (Esther 2:17).
- Mordecai instructs Esther to conceal her Jewish identity (Esther 2:10).
- Mordecai later discovers and foils a plot against the king, saving his life (Esther 2:21-23).

## Key Themes & Lessons
1. **God’s Sovereignty Even in Difficult Circumstances**
   - Esther’s path was shaped by external forces beyond her control.
   - Despite appearing powerless, God was orchestrating events for a greater purpose (Romans 8:28, Proverbs 16:9).

2. **Identity and Cultural Tension**
   - Esther’s dual identity as a Jew and a Persian illustrates the struggles of living in two worlds.
   - Mordecai instructs Esther to hide her Jewish identity, highlighting the challenges of faith under foreign rule (Daniel 1:8, Matthew 5:14-16).

3. **Myrtle Tree Symbolism (Hadassah)**
   - Hadassah means Myrtle Tree, a slow-growing evergreen that thrives in difficult conditions.
   - Myrtle trees are associated with righteousness and resilience in Jewish tradition (Zechariah 1:8-11, Isaiah 55:13).
   - This reflects Esther’s journey—though seemingly powerless, she would grow into a pivotal figure for her people.

4. **God Uses Imperfect People**
   - Unlike Daniel, who openly practiced his faith, Esther initially conceals hers (Daniel 6:10 vs. Esther 2:10).
   - Mordecai and Esther make compromises, yet God still uses them for His purposes.
   - This serves as encouragement that even when we falter, God’s plans are not thwarted (2 Timothy 2:13).

## Connection to Modern Life
- We may find ourselves in situations we did not choose, yet God remains sovereign.
- Even when we struggle with faith and identity, God is still working through us.
- Difficult seasons can be part of God’s preparation for a greater calling.
- The Myrtle Tree reminds us that growth is slow, but God is patient and faithful.

## Looking Ahead
- The tension between Mordecai and Haman (introduced in Chapter 3) will set up the next major conflict.
- Esther’s transformation from a passive participant to an active agent of change will unfold (Esther 4:14).

The story of Esther reminds us that even in unseen ways, God is guiding history and our lives. Our worst moments do not disqualify us from being used by Him.
