## Sermon Information
- **Date:** May 8, 2022
- **Church:** Kairos Christian Church
- **Speaker:** Pastor Peter Yoon
- **Title:** A Myrtle Tree

## Historical Context
- Esther 2 occurs four years after the events of chapter 1.
- King Xerxes had failed in his military campaign against Greece and returns to focus on internal matters.
- A search for a new queen begins to replace Vashti, resulting in Esther’s selection.
- Esther and her cousin Mordecai are introduced; Mordecai is a Jew from the tribe of Benjamin, a descendant of Kish, linking him to King Saul (1 Samuel 9:1-2).
- Esther, also known as Hadassah, represents a bicultural identity as both a Jew and a Persian (Esther 2:7).
- The name Hadassah means “Myrtle tree,” which carries symbolic significance of resilience and righteousness (Isaiah 55:13, Zechariah 1:8).
- Esther was taken into the king’s harem, not by choice, but as a result of a system that resembled forced servitude rather than a fair competition.
- The passive voice is frequently used in Esther 2, highlighting how Esther had little control over her circumstances, yet God was still at work.

## Summary of Chapter 2
- King Xerxes, following the advice of his attendants, searches for a new queen (Esther 2:2-4).
- Young women, including Esther, are taken into the royal harem for preparation before meeting the king (Esther 2:8).
- Esther undergoes 12 months of beauty treatments before her turn with Xerxes (Esther 2:12).
- She wins the king’s favor and is crowned queen (Esther 2:17).
- Mordecai instructs Esther to conceal her Jewish identity (Esther 2:10).
- Mordecai later discovers and foils a plot against the king, saving his life (Esther 2:21-23).

## Key Themes & Lessons

1. **God’s Sovereignty Even in Difficult Circumstances**
   - Esther’s path was shaped by external forces beyond her control.
   - Despite appearing powerless, God was orchestrating events for a greater purpose (Romans 8:28, Proverbs 16:9).
   - The Jews were in exile, and yet, through Esther’s placement, God was preparing salvation for His people.

2. **Identity and Cultural Tension**
   - Esther’s dual identity as a Jew and a Persian illustrates the struggles of living in two worlds.
   - Mordecai instructs Esther to hide her Jewish identity, highlighting the challenges of faith under foreign rule (Daniel 1:8, Matthew 5:14-16).
   - Unlike Daniel, who took a public stand for his faith, Esther remains silent, showing different ways God can use His people.

3. **Myrtle Tree Symbolism (Hadassah)**
   - Hadassah means Myrtle Tree, a slow-growing evergreen that thrives in difficult conditions.
   - Myrtle trees are associated with righteousness and resilience in Jewish tradition (Zechariah 1:8-11, Isaiah 55:13).
   - Just as the myrtle tree survives and flourishes in hard conditions, Esther’s journey reflects God’s sustaining power over His people.

4. **God Uses Imperfect People**
   - Esther and Mordecai do not openly practice their faith like other biblical figures, yet God still uses them for His purposes.
   - Mordecai advises Esther to hide her identity, which seems to contradict faithfulness, yet God remains in control.
   - This serves as encouragement that even when we falter, God’s plans are not thwarted (2 Timothy 2:13).

5. **God is Sovereign in Our Worst Moments**
   - Esther and Mordecai go along with the pagan culture rather than resisting it, but God still works through them.
   - Unlike Daniel and his companions who refused to conform, Esther adapts, yet God does not abandon her.
   - This reminds us that even when we make mistakes or compromise, God can still redeem and use us.

## Connection to Modern Life
- We may find ourselves in situations we did not choose, yet God remains sovereign.
- Even when we struggle with faith and identity, God is still working through us.
- Difficult seasons can be part of God’s preparation for a greater calling.
- The Myrtle Tree reminds us that growth is slow, but God is patient and faithful.
- We should not disqualify ourselves from being used by God because of our weaknesses or past mistakes.

## Discussion Questions
- Can you relate to the statement: “God is sovereign in our worst circumstances?” Does a particular circumstance come to mind?
- Have you ever felt like you were sidelined because of your past mistakes? How does this message encourage you?
- How does the story of Hadassah (Esther) encourage those who feel they are in exile or far from where they expected to be?
- Who is one person you can encourage who is going through a difficult season in their life?

## Looking Ahead
- The tension between Mordecai and Haman (introduced in Chapter 3) will set up the next major conflict.
- Esther’s transformation from a passive participant to an active agent of change will unfold (Esther 4:14).

---

The story of Esther reminds us that even in unseen ways, God is guiding history and our lives. Our worst moments do not disqualify us from being used by Him. Just as the myrtle tree represents resilience and endurance, we too can trust that God is working through us, even in seasons of hardship and uncertainty.
