[Music] uh good morning um it's great to be with you all my name is Phil if you're new or visiting um I'm one of the pastors here uh and and thanks for joining us uh this special Sunday um I also just wanted to make a a quick well first of all happy Father's Day um to the fathers in our congregation and um you know as I was driving over here I was even thinking um you know sometimes this day actually means different things for different people and um you know I as I was driving here I was thinking of the new fathers uh who just this is their first Father's Day the the joy that might be welling up in their hearts um as they think about the importance of being a father um but also think about um people who have lost fathers uh in this past year and this might be the first year that um they're experiencing without uh their fathers um I I I think about people who want to be fathers and are going through a season of infertility and how difficult it may be and uh even father even people who have had uh complicated relationships or perhaps never experienced relationships with their fathers so it is a very complicated day but um you know we hold this tension where you know we we celebrate um and honor the fathers um and we also um acknowledge that it is difficult for some people as well um but today is Father's day and we do have a Father's Day picnic afterwards um to just come together as a church family so if you're new if you're visiting oh hey Jamal good to see you um you know if you're if you're new or uh joining us or visiting um just please join us afterwards

everything ready so please thank them uh as we spend uh just a beautiful summer day together out at Nobel Park okay um you know we are in the Book of Esther series and we're in part eight of our Book of Esther Series this is the eth chapter of the book and we'll be wrapping up the Book of Esther next week uh chapters 9 and 10 and then in July we're going to be going to a series on first John uh and then uh we also have some guest speakers to come as well but you know as we're nearing the End of This Book uh we're coming to all the resolutions for all the conflicts all the tensions that has uh been happening throughout this book if you remember last week pastor Peter um talked about the great reversal right after the second banquet uh Queen Esther reveals her true identity as a Jew and how Hon's plan to annihilate all the Jews would impact her and her people and so here we see this great reversal where um you know just just blender after blender or coincidence after coincidence hmon ends up being impaled on the very pole that he set up for morai to be executed on and so we see this great reversal and so that's where we're picking up in this chapter with the conclusion uh of the account of hmon and this morning this sermon is called uh an Edict of Salvation now the author calls hmon the enemy of the Jews hmon this agagite he is the enemy of the Jews and as we've been going through the Book of Esther we see how he has been prevailing right he has been getting promoted and promoted and he sits at the right hand of the king himself so he's second in command even in these two Banquets that we see he is the only one that has been invited and so we see how it it almost seems like the wicked is prevailing and that's actually a motif throughout the Bible where it says that the wicked may enjoy a temporary success but they will not Prevail at the end we see hmon his success does not last forever it's temporary because the great reversal has changed his fortune into Misfortune and at the apex of the Book of Esther where nothing else seems to to be going wrong for hmon and and everything seems to be going wrong for Mori and the Jewish people we see this switch this great reversal this change of direction as far as for the fortunes of both hmon and Queen Esther and Mori hmon begins to lose his footing the favor that he had and the success that he enjoyed begins to slip from his hands and so when we look at these first two verses I want you to think about the irony that is spelled out here Esther 8: 1 and2 says that same day King xeri gave Queen Esther the estate of hmon the enemy of the Jews and Mori came into the presence of the king for Esther had told him how he was related to her the king took off his signant ring which he had reclaimed from hmon and presented it to morai and Esther appointed him over Hon's estate now what is the irony here well the irony is that King xeri ends up giving Queen Esther all of the estate of hmon after he is executed and Esther actually appoints morai to be the one in charge of this state and so all the wealth that belonged to hyon all of the riches that he has amassed what he boasted about to his family and friends ends up in the hands of the one that he hated the most and not only that we see that the signate ring that was taken off of Hon's hand this symbol of power and authority that hmon craved so much that he used and wielded for this demonic plan to annihilate the Jews it ends up in the hands of morai his mortal enemy the one that he hated the most it's like adding insult to injury the wealth the power The Authority that he boasted about to his family and friends is in an instant Stripped Away From Him and given to his enemy now this is by no means a direct application but it did get me thinking how much stock do we put in the power and the wealth and the authority that we have here on this Earth perhaps a little bit too much I don't know about you but for me sometimes I think that it it is more important than it actually is and you know It's Tricky It's Tricky right because we we aren't naive to the point where we deny money and influence as carrying weight in this world and at the same time I think when I look at the conclusion of Hon's life how he put so much trust in these things and how it was just taken away in an instant so many factors that influence the end of his life I wonder again how much stock do we put in the power the wealth The Authority that we can gain in this life it reminds me of the parable of the rich fool that Jesus tells in Luke 12 and the context is someone in the crowd comes to him and says teacher tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me and Jesus replies man who appointed me a judge or an Arbiter between you then he said to them watch out be on your guard against all kinds of greed life does not consist in an abundance of possessions and he told in this Parable the ground of a certain rich man yielded an abundant Harvest he thought to himself what shall I do I have no place to store my crops then he said this is what I will do I will tear down my Barns and build bigger ones and there I will store my Surplus grain and I'll say to myself you have plenty of grain laid up for many years take life easy eat drink and be merry but God said to him you fool this very night your life will be demanded from you then who will get what you have prepared for yourself this is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich towards God to be Frank I hope that the life and death of hmon would serve as a reminder for all of us you see we may not plan to use our power our wealth our resources for ill means for devious means like hmon did but take this as a reminder whether you have a little or a lot don't put too much stock in the treasures that you can amass in this world they're all fleeting because we don't know the number of our days and we won't be bringing those Treasures with us but be rich towards God accumulating Treasures that will not be destroyed now moving along in the chapter um this is kind of the conclusion of the account with hmon but the plan to to to destroy all the Jews is still in motion right Esther is moving on to the larger problem at hand the plan to destroy destroy all of the Jews and we first learned about this edict in Esther chapter 3 if you remember hmon had come up with this plan to annihilate the Jewish people he cast lots and it falls on the 13th day of the 12th month so basically this this edict is going to happen on the 13th day of the 12th month where the enemies of the Jew have permission to kill to plunder to destroy the Jewish people and hmon sends out this edict on the following day and if you remember the edict goes out the day before the Passover feast and what the Passover feast is meant to be is a reminder of God's Deliverance of God's salvation for the Jewish people and so you can imagine as a Jewish person getting this edict the day before the Passover feast how how just the timing of it how frightening how terrifying how anxious you might be now where we are is about the third month so a few months have passed by and they've been living under the tyranny of this first edict the fear of the death and destruction that was to come and it's still in effect and so we read in verse three Esther pleads with the King she comes to the king and pleads with him and falls at his feet and weeps she begs him to put an end to the evil plan of hmon the agagite which he had devised against the Jews and so the king extends the gold scepter to Esther and she arose and stood before him if it pleases the king she said and if he regards me with favor and thinks it the right thing to do and if he is pleased with me let an order be written overruling the dispatches that hmon some Son of Heda the agagite devised and wrote to destroy the Jews in all the king's provinces for how can I bear to see disaster fall on my people how can I bear to see the destruction of my family so Esther comes to the king she's asking him to revoke this edict that is still in effect right this edict that that hmon had constructed for the destruction of the Jews and this is King xi's reply he says because hmon attacked the Jews I have given his estate to Esther and they have impaled him on the poll he set up now write another decree in the king's name on behalf of the Jews as seems best to you and seal it with the king's signate ring for no document written in the king's name and sealed with his ring can be revoked so here's the problem the Edict of the king cannot be revoked the king in his rash decision allows for the first edict to go out and it cannot be revoked no document written with the king's name and sealed with his signate ring can be revoked so instead a new edict must go out one that counters the initial edict so keep that in mind as we read on verse N9 at once the Royal secretaries were summoned on the 23rd day of the third month the month of Savon they wrote out they wrote out all mori's orders to the Jews and to the satraps governors and Nobles of the 127 provinces stretching from India to Kush these orders were written the script of each province and the language of each people and also to the Jews in their own script and language morai wrote In The Name of King Xerxes sealed the dispatches with the king's signate ring and sent them by mounted couriers who rode fast horses especially bread for the king the king's EDI granted the Jews in every city the right to assemble and protect themselves to destroy kill and annihilate the armed men of any nationality or Province who might attack them and their women and children and to plunder the property of their enemies the day appointed for the Jews to do this in all the provinces of King xerses was the 13th day of the 12th month the month of Adar so this is the same exact day the same exact day that the first edict was to take effect this new edict goes out allowing the Jews to defend themselves against their enemies now this is very important because I don't know if you knew this but the first edict did not allow the Jews to defend themselves they were to stand idly by because if they were to defend themselves they would incur the Wrath of the king they needed permission to actually defend themselves against the attacks of their enemies and so if I could put it this way in the first edict they were defenseless they were helpless there was nothing that they could do to stop the enemy from attacking them but now that this new counter edict was in place they were able to gather to defend themselves and their property against their enemy so this edict was issued and sent out to all the provinces the first edict was an Edict of death the second edict an Edict of Salvation now even though there's no direct mention of the Gospel here I think when we assess what's going on here and we see the patterns of how God operates the Book of Esther and the Deliverance of Jew the Jewish people from the hands of hmon points to the pattern of God's deliverance and I think we can use it as a framework when we think of our own salvation our own Deliverance I mean isn't this the case for us as well right we know that the wages of sin is death and that all have fallen short of the glory of God if I could put it this way we too were under an Edict of death we were helpless we were defenseless against the consequences of sin which is death and not just a physical death this separation from life but a spiritual death and eternal separation from the lifegiver himself we were defenseless helpless under the Edict of death and despair that was too much for us to overcome and it could not be revoked this edict could not be revoked and yet Romans 5 chap uh Romans chap 5:8 tells us that while we were still Sinners while we were enemies of God while we were deserving of death because of the treason that we committed against God while we were still sinners Christ died for us Romans 5:6 says that just at the right time this Greek word here is the name of our church chyos chyos is the Divine appoint appointed time what at this Divine appointed time at just at the right time while we were powerless Christ came to die for the ungodly because of his sacrifice The Curse Of Death has been removed the Edict of death and despair had been countered with the second edict a counter edict if you will the Edict of salvation again it had not been revoked or replaced but this second edict that comes with the blood of Jesus has countered the Edict of death and despair and we now live under the Edict of Salvation you know I was driving here and I was thinking again about you know these two edicts and I was thinking the second edict makes no sense without the first edict the second edict this Edict of Salvation makes no sense if we do not know what we're being saved from if we do not understand the consequences of sin this curse and sting of sin and death how can we rejoice as people who have heard the second edict how would we know what we're being saved from and so these two edicts come hand in hand in fact that's why when we share the gospel with people we emphasize repentance turning away from sin because we know the consequences consequences of sin and death and we understand what we are being saved from that it is good news that Christ came to die for us so that that this new Edict of Salvation would Reign Over Us listen to the to what Paul says to the church in Ephesus this is Ephesians chapter 2 he says as for you you were dead in your transgressions and sins dead in your transgressions in which you used to live when you follow the ways of this world and the ruler of the kingdom of the air the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient all of us also lived among them at one time gratifying the Cravings of our flesh and following its desires and thoughts like the rest we were by Nature deserving of w wrath this is the first edict right we were dead in our transgression we were defenseless and helpless because there's nothing that we could do under this first edict it's not Christianity is not something where we help ourselves get out of this but it is recognition that we were dead in our trespasses our very nature deserving of Wrath you know unlike the Jewish people in the story of Esther where they were like what's going on all of a sudden this Ed came out we were people that were deserving of Wrath our sin and Disobedience being the very reason that our destiny was death but here comes verse four right verse four says but but God because of his love for us who is rich in Mercy made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in our transgressions for it is by Grace you have been saved thank God it did not end with the first edict that there is a butt there is a second edict that comes and this is where the great reversal comes for us verse 6 says and God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the Heavenly Realms in Christ Jesus in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable Riches of his grace expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus for it is by Grace you have been saved through faith and this is not from yourselves it is a gift of God not by works so that none can boast see we are people of two edicts right just like the Jewish people who receive two edicts we are people who have received the Edict of death and destruction but we have also received the Edict of Salvation praise God for that that is the good news that we live under that is why we can rejoice and celebrate now coming back to the story we see this edict is issued but it needs to go out into all the provinces it needs to made known to everyone within the Persian Empire and and it can't wait another second to go out in fact they designate the fastest horses to bring these news to all the provinces verse 13 we read a copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every Province and made known to the people of every nationality so that the Jews would be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies the couriers riding the Royal horses went out spurred on by the King's Command and the edict was issued in the Citadel of Susa so every person of every nationality in every Province was to be made aware of this second edict right this is actually not only for the benefit of the Jewish people but actually to all who belong to the Persian Empire everyone was to hear this edict and it was to serve also as a warning to the enemies of the Jews that they would no longer be able to ruthlessly attack and plunder the Jewish people without expecting some push back in fact if we skip to the end of this chapter we actually see that many people of other nationalities became Jews because fear of the Jews had seized them but this new edict is extra good if I could use that that term it's extra good news for the Jews and if I come back to the analogy of how this story connects with us we also have the good news don't we we have the good news of the second edict and we are commanded to bring the good news of the second edict to the ends of the Earth there's a sense of urgency that we are to bring it out we're challenged with this sense of urgency in proclaiming the good news of this second edict this Gospel of Salvation that we have heard of the fact that though our destiny was death now our Destin Destiny is life imagine that being one of the couriers one of the people carrying this important and and Urgent news to the ends of the Earth well imagine no further that is you that is me we are called to be messengers of the good news right that is the Great Commission that has been given to us you know a couple months ago a group of UCSD students came and and they asked if they could meet with me and you know whenever I hear that I go uhoh you know something's wrong right um they want to talk talk to me about something so I'm preparing myself and you know it goes both ways whenever I message people I just want to hang out but for some reason people think they're in trouble or something and and so they're kind of all nervous but these students that came to me and they were like you know is it okay if we do some more campus evangelism and I was like preparing myself for the worst and I was like yeah of course sure I mean who you know it's it's interesting like I I don't expect people to say can we evangelize more uh sometimes I think we're you know just we we look at evangelism and sharing our faith as something that's so scary and not that these students were not scared but they sense this urgency right this good news we want to tell people about the good news it was totally not what I was expected but uh what I was expecting but it was so special and I was so challenged by them and every year that I've been at chyos there's always been people who have championed evangelism in our midst and and and I'm so grateful for that um people that remind us that we are to be faithful to the Great Commission right sharing the good news with others what a blessing it is to hear that as a pastor that people actually want to evangelize and you know I know that may not be the case for everyone but when you hear that doesn't that challenge you not in like an empty challenge but wow like not like you know good for them but something that says you're right I do have good news I am a carrier of this message that is so important if you are relatively new to our church two of our core values um is missions and church planning and our church has always desired to be involved in sending out missionaries um in in in short-term missions and long-term misss um one-year interns Church planners in fact in a few weeks actually our oneyear interns from Guatemala will be returning and at the end of next month we're going to be having a luncheon uh after service to just hear um you know some some just updates uh from them and so I want to invite you to join uh if you are able to or if you know them personally but you know from my perspective one of the strengths of our church was is that we are we desire to participate with what God is doing in this world and I remember at a prayer meeting many many years ago I was praying for chyos and I I saw this image of one of those aircraft carriers right those aircraft carriers that sent out those aircrafts uh and you know as I was praying I just got the sense that God was going to use chyos as a sending church and sure enough many short-term and long-term missionaries have been sent out from this church and we have been blessed to be able to participate with what God is doing around the world and then when Co hit um with all the travel restriction restrictions they kind of put a temporary pause uh on at least how we could um physically go and join but you know as these international restrictions begin to lift I want to encourage us as a church to renew our commitment and our desire to participate with what God is doing all across this world that global missions is important and we want to be a part of that but in the same ve I want to same vein I want to encourage us to engage in local missions as well that we are in San Diego for a reason in fact as we were um as you heard in the announcement this Outreach committee you know one of the things a few weeks ago we had our staff planning meeting and we were just talking about our engagement in San Diego and you know a lot of times I think there's a bottleneck within the staff because you know having to take care of a lot of the different Church Affairs sometimes kind of it stops and stops with the staff and it doesn't is isn't able to continue progressing and so Esther had this wonderful idea like hey let's come up with a committee to just see what people are doing in San Diego how we can be involved and and we're GNA have a season of discernment how we can as a church be engaged with what God is doing in this city and so if you have a heart for that I know a lot of you are perhaps already involved in different organizations you're already involved in doing what God is doing in in the city of San Diego but we want to come together as a church and implore our church and exort our church to be involved in what God is doing here in the city of San Diego because local missions is important as well and I'm not trying to elevate one over the other because both are important right the biblical Paradigm of missions is not just one of global missions but local as well if you remember in the book of Acts a lot of times we look at this book and we see Paul the Apostle Paul going on these missionary Journeys right he's going and he's planting and he's coming back reporting and and Gathering resources and going out again and so a lot of times our view of missions is just going out there but I want you to remember that a lot of how the missions happened was through a local context that the the the people who had come to Jerusalem for the Feast of Pentecost when they were touched by the Holy Spirit they ended up staying because they really enjoyed just being there learning and then if you remember what happened persecution hit right and they all scattered they went back to their hometowns and so in in a sense the the the gospel moved to these different cities because of people who were moving back to their Hometown it happened in a very local context as well and so the Paradigm for evangelism and for Missions is both and it's not just global missions it's not just local missions is both Global and local and we want to be a church that renews our commitment and desire to be people bearing the good news of Jesus Christ to the ends of the Earth but also here in San Diego as well so when we think about what it looks like here in San Diego what does it look like what is our role as couriers who have the good news of the second edict where can I bring it where should I bring it I think a lot of you perhaps have participated already unknowingly it's to your classmates it's to your campuses it's to your workplaces it's to the children the foster children the the the the the single mothers it's to the the homeless Community it's to people around us our family members we bring the good news with us wherever we go again not just globally but locally as well now when I think about evangelism um I know it's sometimes a very scary thing it's it's not always smooth sailing when I think about evangelism I you know when I think about the person that um I I I I I I think about with evangelism I think about my neighbor that lives across the street it's this elderly couple and you know when we move to San Diego um one of the things that we want to do is to get to know our neighbors um better and so we invited them over for dinner once and I remember trying to Fumble my way uh you know and sharing the gospel with them and you know he kind of politely just like oh you know that that's good and good for you and then we kind the conversation kind of moved on and ever since that point I'm like now how do I like bring it up again like you know after the first time it's like now it's just kind of weird and and so I I I know it's difficult right it's it's not always easy um it can be discouraging at times but I want to encourage us even when we think about evangelism not we don't have to think so um so vastly but it could just be that one person that we've been praying for it could just be that one person that we've been thinking about that God has placed in our our minds and in our hearts and and we can can can use every opportunity that that comes to pass to to share about the goodness of God about how he has saved us about this second Edict of freedom and salvation so I want to challenge all of us to SM start small just think about one person who you want to share with and and and be faithful to God's call in our lives to bring the good news to those around us now finally as we wrap up this morning I want to talk about this cause for celebration so let's read the the rest of this chapter starting from verse 15 says when Mori left the king's presence he was wearing Royal garments of blue and white a large crown of gold and a purple robe of fine linen and the City of Susa held a joyous celebration for the Jews it was a time of happiness and joy gladness and honor in every Province and in every city to which the Edict of the king came there was joy and gladness among the Jews with feasting and celebrating and many people of other nationalities became Jews because fear of the Jews had seized them and so we see here the reversal actually continues and the author is very intentional in helping us notice and and understand this reversal and one of the things is we consider the clothing that morai wears right the author points out throughout the Book of Esther what mori's wearing if you remember in Esther chapter 4 after the first edict goes out morai tears his clothes he puts on sack clothes and Ashes he's wailing bitterly and lamenting and he's outside of the city unable to go into the presence of the king that is the clothes that is he's wearing and then in Esther chapter 6 if you remember Mori is honored by the very garments that hmon desired the the garments of the royal king uh that would honor him for the day but it was only temporary in that chapter and finally when we look at this chapter we look Mor we see morai emerges from the king's presence with royal garments crown of gold and a purple robe of fine lemon it's more of a permanent fixture now he is the head of the state head adviser to the king from sackcloth and Ashes to Royal garments what a reversal what a reversal that he has experienced but not only is the situation reversed for morai it's reversed for all of the Jews again verse verse 16 for the Jews it was a time of happiness and joy gladness and honor and I didn't catch this the first time but one commentary points out that when you look at the four words Happiness joy gladness and honor it's like they're the antithesis of the four words mourning fasting weeping and wailing that's mentioned in Esther chapter 4 and in in chapter 3 you remember the city of Susa was thrown into confusion conf usion after the first edict goes out there's confusion in the city but now after the second edict goes out the people shout and rejoice they have received the message of Salvation it is good news you know today happens to be juneth and it gets his name from combining June and 19th and I I thought it was so fitting uh that this passage would come at this day but June juneth was initially celebrated just within the black community but over time became adopted as state holidays and as of last year it is a Federal holiday now to give a brief history lesson on it even though the mancipation Proclamation was signed on January 1st 1863 by President Abraham Lincoln it declared that all persons held as slaves were to be free but at that time only a few of them actually became free now the civil war finally ended on April 9th 1865 but it wasn't until June 19th 1865 when Major General Gordon Granger who had fought for the union led a force of soldiers into galvaston Texas to deliver this very important message that the war was over the union had won and now they finally have the manpower to enforce the Emancipation Proclamation now slavery didn't completely end on that day but June 19th was chosen as the day to celebrate and if I could put it this way it was the day that the message and the backing of the government reached Galveston one former slave Felix Haywood recalled everyone went wild we all felt like Heroes just like that we were free I can't begin to imagine the type of joy and celebration that would have erupted from the black community after they had received this important message being under the weight of slavery in the same way I cannot begin to imagine the joy and the celebration that that had erupted from the Jewish Community after being under an Edict of death from hmon himself now now to receive this wonderful news this second Edict of Salvation written by Mori and Queen Esther but there is something that you and I have experienced that is caused for celebration see the Bible tells us we were once under the slavery of sin and death but because of Christ we have also been freed from that slavery we now belong to God we were once not a people of God now we have been called people of God we were once people who did not receive Mercy now we are people who have received Mercy we have received the message of the Edict of Salvation with the backing of the government of God enforcing the freedom that we can now declare with confidence we are free we are a freed people we have experienced the greatest reversal and doesn't that make us the people with the most cause for celebration listen to the psalm of David it's from Psalm 30: 11-2 says you turn turned my wailing into dancing you remove my sackcloth and clothed me with joy that my heart may sing your praises and not be silent Lord my God I will praise you forever isn't that our song as well God you have turned our wailing into dancing you've removed our sack claw and clothed us clothed us with joy you know when Jesus started in his public Ministry he walks into a synagogue as a rabbi a young Rabbi during Sabbath and he unrolls The Scroll of Isaiah and he reads this passage message the spirit of The Sovereign Lord is on me because the Lord has appointed me anointed me to Proclaim good news to the poor he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim freedom for the captives and release from Darkness for the prisoners to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor in the day of Vengeance of our God to comfort all who mourn and provide for those who grieve and Zion to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of Ashes the oil of Joy instead of mourning and a Garment of Praise instead of a spirit of of Despair they will be called Oaks of righteousness a planting of the Lord for the display of his Splendor and then Jesus stops and he says today the scripture is fulfilled in your hearing it's fulfilled in Jesus because of Jesus we' have been given a crown of beauty instead of Ashes because of Jesus we have the oil of Joy instead of mourning we have a Garment of Praise instead of a spirit of Despair we have reason to celebrate and that's you know one of the reasons why our worship team this morning I said let us he said let us celebrate you know we we do understand that there are songs that cause cause us to contemplate or lament at times but we have also reason to celebrate and I want to invite us as we wrap up uh this morning to celebrate by singing I I don't know if we're actually going to sing this song I are we singing Trading My Sorrows okay cool um you know we're going to sing Trading My Sorrows okay and again we want to invite everyone to just be free to to worship years ago I attended a gospel music concert at uh the San Diego fair and and the set was led by Israel newbreed um and it was amazing being there not just enjoying the music but really to see this expression of worship that is so Lively and so celebratory and if you've ever been to a black church or a coner a gospel gospel music concert you understand what I'm talking about but everyone was just moving and you know it sometimes it feels so foreign uh to us because as a a more predominant Asian-American Church culture we're we're more used to contemplative music right where we you know just close our eyes and we think about the words right or you know we'll lift our hands a little bit and just like you know worship God and yeah you know I'm all for that as well but there's also times where I think we are to be blessed by this expression of worship this celebration that is to erupt in our hearts something sometimes jumping and you know I'm not going to ask us to jump I think that's a little too sudden but sometimes we need to jump and we need to dance and Sway and and lift our hands high and you know Psalm 149 says praise the Lord sing to the Lord a new song his praise in the Assembly of his faithful people let Israel rejoice in their maker let the people of Zion be glad in their King let them Praise His Name with dancing and make music to him with timberl and harp for the Lord takes the light in his people he crowns The Humble Victory let his faithful people rejoice in this honor and sing for Joy on their B beds and you know I I went to Israel a few years ago and just at Sabbath you know all the Jews came um and and there's like this huge celebration they were dancing together they were like singing the Psalms and um you know it was just incredible to see and and there's this celebration that erupts um look at the words in this Psalm says Sing For Joy right Rejoice praise dance make music I mean if you ask me these are very expressive words and I just picture this huge celebration during worship don't you right there's this this this excitement that kind of just overflows out of our beings and I get it we're self-conscious right for me when I'm at home and you know we watch the chyos kids music video sometimes with our kids and I'm dancing with my my daughter and you know I one time I even like pulled a muscle because I was just jumping and you know you'll never see me do it here I I know I'm more subdued at church so I get it I get it we're self-conscious but if we could just even as an application just move the needle a little a little bit just be a little less self-conscious just be a little more free to you know maybe like you feel like you can move your hands from your pockets to like here that that's that's awesome or like you know slowly like I don't know and maybe like I mean some of you have good Rhythm like just go in the aisles and dance um you know be free to worship because there is cause for celebration as we think of the good news the the the fact that we were once under this Edict of death and despair but now we are people who are under the Edict of Salvation let that be the reason that we celebrate let that be the reason that we are free to lift our hands to dance to sway to the beat of the the song to sing unto the Lord so worship team come on up um we're going to just worship as we wrap up um actually worship team and then whoever is praying for offering prayer uh if you could come up um to pray for us um as we respond again this application let's celebrate and let's be free to express our worship unto the Lord
