back to school get back home but um let's congratulate Kevin and his wife chrisy they'll be joining us soon okay all right so we're um launch in into a new series in the Book of Esther and I don't know if you've had a chance to read it but I think this book is great the story is uh riveting it just captures you there's a great reversal in fact uh if we kind of think about literary context the historical and some of the cultural context that um I had referred to last week in our word of God series um it's it's good for us to talk a little bit about that so that we dive into this book it makes more sense to us it we we can kind of visualize it almost imagine it did you guys see the movie 300 did you watch it even though you weren't 18 years old at that time okay anyway my kids too anyway um so if you watch the 300 the I know Sparta the Spartans were the main characters it's totally fictional but one thing that was historically true is King xery he does attack Greece and I'll get into that okay that that is one historical fact that was actually accurate everything else was made for TV or made for movie and it was very entertaining and it was a fun movie to watch but we're going to be talking about King xerses because the Book of Esther actually takes place right in that time period where King xerses he's the fourth King of Persia where he is in control he is the king he is the monarch over the Persian Empire and the Persian EMP Empire some historians would say might be even after Egypt and Babylon the first great really the superpower the superpower of its day of History um some may say that anyway the Book of Esther is written within that context and it's actually a a satire and of a book of irony a Twist and Turn some will say we see the god of reversals you know the story is heading in this direction and all of a sudden it reverses the trajectory of the story completely reverses and that's the point in which in which we really see God's sovereignty God working and turning things around for the Jewish people um I found this online the title is of today's message is Queen vashti's dignity we'll be focusing on her but I found this online I know it's hard to see um I just bring it as a reference if you want it I can email to you but I I bring this as a reference just for context of when is this story of Esther taking place um as king xeres is in power this book talks about a time when a decree was an ordinance a law was passed the the effect of the law would create the the genocide of all Jewish people and so the entire race of the Jews were in effect it was hanging on the balance and it's Esther that is used to turn that law around now this book of Esther it still gets read today on a day called purm okay do any of you have like religiously devout Jewish friends anybody okay because this day the PM um was observed back in March 16th a little bit over a month ago on March 16th uh they celebrated purm they continue to celebrate this day called purm purm comes from the word the lot you throw a lot and you're taking a guess but that's where it comes from and the on on this day I was looking up some background uh information on the day of perm I I don't have many Jewish friends either so I was looking it up on the internet and one article interestingly say on the day of purin it is the one day one religious holiday where the Jewish moms and dads and the parents they let loose and they go barar that that's what the title said they let loose and go berserk you know I I don't know what that would I I can't imagine what that would be but even the kids they're wearing costumes on this day and it's just a day an evening that passes where they are filled with joy lots of play lots of drinking just lots of food and even the kids who see their parents feel like wow Mom and Dad are really happy to be Jews today so that's how the article explains it and the reason for that reason that they celebrate and observe this day of porum even you know today is because it's the day that they were saved from genocide through Esther and they're so delighted they celebrate their Jewish Heritage their Jewish culture and they read the story once in the morning as a family as a community and they come back together in the evening and wrap up the day with reading of Esther once again and as they read through the Esther the Book of Esther it's going to feel a little bit different here but they actually like laugh together because it's SA it's Jewish humor and so in my mind I haven't ever been in a setting like this I'd love to see it one day and maybe I should look up in YouTube how it's read but when the villain of the story hmon is mentioned I just imagine in my mind bunch of kids listening to this story being read they're like Boo hyon anytime his name gets mentioned they actively engage and participate by saying boo to hmon who ordered the the edict to um execute all of the Jews so that's a little bit of the literary background now historically where it takes place again it's during the time of a king named King xerses he's the fourth King of the Persian Empire he was that really weird-looking dude in the movie 300 but very very powerful very powerful and it was earlier part of his career which started at about 460 BC 460 BC historically we know that's when he started his Reign um early on there were some H what do you call it uh revolts in in these regions and he had to deal with these revolts as a king and so we're going to look at you know what was going on now one really well known and if you don't know this that's okay but really well-known feature of Esther is that God's name anything about God is actually not mentioned at all in the entire Book of Esther and so for those who are considering the cannon of scripture they really wrestled with should This Book of Esther be actually included in the 66 books in The 39 books of the Old Testament or not but I think as they began to understand the theological conviction behind the story um they came together and were led to include the Book of Esther into the Canon of scripture but there is no mention of God no mention of the law no mention of the fathers of their faith in fact the whole story um there's one other book that the whole story takes place outside of Israel outside of Jerusalem and Esther is one of them Daniel is the other one written during that Persian Exile um and so some people find it odd that a book that basically writes about Kings and a queen named uh Esther Finds Its way into scripture but that's where the irony is that the writer um and some people think it's morai will be introduced to the character morai in the story but some people think it's morai who wrote the story because the writer had understanding of the Persian culture Persian Court they say the Paradox of not mentioning God is really what brings our attention into the book here's a little quote from one of the commentators it is this Paradox which both makes Esther such a strange book within the Bible and yet at the same time one which is of great importance for those of us especially today living in post christiandom postchristian culture why because where we need to live out our faith and a world where we often cannot name God directly there are many days where we don't see what is God up to what is God up to when the pandemic started two years ago what was it that God was doing was he had he fallen asleep is he in control a lot of questions go through our mind theologically trying to see what is God doing there are times in our individual lives never mind the whole Global macro level but even in our own situations and circumstances where we feel like where is God why is the name the the workings of God so difficult to discern and see have you ever gone through Seasons where you just felt like you were going through a dry season we called it sometimes just desert period but it is this message of Esther that helps us to recognize even though God's name might not be overtly seen he is present he is there you don't hear him you don't see him overtly but God who is there that is the Crux of this um the Book of Esther and we'll be see looking at that more um closely as we go through the book so let's go through the first chapter we're going to go chapter at a time um it has 10 chapters the last chapter is really short it just explains the Book of Esther is why uh Jews still celebrate porm today but we'll go through these chapters looking at the characters at some of the plots the subplots and some of the twists and the turns today we're going to we're going to uh focus on Queen vashi and her dignity and there's a mini conflict that arises that sets up the story for the rest of Esther but I think God is doing something within this conflict and the silly resolution that King xeres comes up with okay let's look at what God is doing so I'm going to be reading through the book um through the chapter 1 and then kind of in interjecting some thoughts and and facts that are important for us to catch so this is what happened during the time of xerses um the xerses who ruled over 127 provinces stretching from India to Kush and at that time King xeres reigned from his Royal throne in the Citadel of Susa and in the third year of his Reign he gave a banquet for all of his Nobles and officials the military leaders of Persia and media the princes the Nobles of the provinces were present for four verses okay when these days were over the king gave a banquet so you know 6 months wasn't long enough and this one lasting 7 Days in the enclosed Garden of the king's Palace for all the people from the least to the greatest who were in The Citadel of Susa the garden had hangings of white and blue linen fastened with cords of white linen and purple material to silver rings and marble pillars there were couches of gold and silver on Mosaic Pavements of poery Marble Marble mother of pearl and other costly Stones wine was served in goblets of gold can you imagine that each one different from the other this is a wine tasting party and the Royal wine was abundant in keeping with the king's liberality by the King's Command each guest was allowed to drink with no restrictions drink as much as you'd like okay for the king instructed all the wine stewards to serve each man what he wished now verse n says Queen vashi also gave a banquet for the women in the Royal palaces of King zeri so here Queen having her own separate banquet with the women while the men are just drinking and getting drunk at this long 7-Day party now remember King xeri his real goal his ultimate goal was Greece and that's because Greece had actually defeated King darus his dad his dad attacked Greece a generation before and face defeat and so for King xeres to rise into this Persian Empire the great Empire and established himself as a great ruler perhaps even the greatest King up until that time is the then to take Greece and make Greece subject of the Persian Empire so that's what he's preparing for this party isn't just to throw a party for the sake of celebrating who he is or showing off his cast not Castle his his Empire his Citadel it was to actually bring all the military leaders the Nobles of the 127 provinces and make sure they're in line their alliances with him to attack Greece and he accomplishes that even the many revolts over in Babylon and the many Revolt of Egypt he's able to quench put it down and get them in line so we're seeing a king that is actually Savvy politically military he's smart he knows how to win people towards his side and he is about to attack Greece um as a story continues it's the seventh day it's the last day of the party on the seventh day when King xeri was in High Spirits from wine that's a nice way of saying he was totally drunk completely intoxicated he commanded the seven unic who served him meuman b harbona b Zar and carcass to bring before him Queen vashi wearing her royal crown why in order to display her beauty to the people and the Nobles for she was lovely to look at but when the attendants delivered the King's Command Queen vashi dared she refused to come here then the writer brings us to the first conflict of the story the conflict between Queen vashi and King Vash King xerses who is the most powerful person in the Empire at that time and when she refused to come naturally the king became Furious and burned with anger his authority being diminished challenged the queen not obeying his command and all he wanted to do was display how beautiful his wife was display how beautiful beautiful queen Bashi was for all to see you have a beautiful beautiful wife beautiful queen rules all over Persia what's so bad about that why would Queen vashi refuse to join the king in his quarter so when there's a conflict in the story this is a good time for us to slow down and try to figure out what's going on it's the writer's device to show us what is the resolution that the the characters will come up with um the bidding that King xeri want to just basically display her beauty to the people and to the Nobles and the queen says no culturally speaking I found out digging through some of the commentaries that women of royalty women of dignity Queen vasy basically um these parties these Banquets where the men were drunk and they were acting in Gross manners immorally um women with any kind of honor and it avoided those scenarios those contexts in fact it was culturally more appropriate for Queen vasi not to enter this Banquet Hall it was culturally appropriate that she should remain with the women holding the banquet of her own um I want to look at this from Queen vash's kind of perspective point of view use a little bit of imagination but also bring back some of I I think a details of the text that we can easily Overlook um I know a lot of you aren't parents but I perhaps you've had conversation with your parents perhaps you didn't but one of the conversations that takes place in our home is like what do you want to be when you grow up did you ever talk about that your parents ever ask you what do you want to be when you grow up yeah just kind of give me a a little bit of an nod if that's a conversation you remember having okay that's good that's that's good um I imagine once you become married have children and your children comes to that stage of life where they're thinking about what they want to become you'll have this conversation so every now and then with our own children we talk about what you want to be and from my boys I want to play football right I want to be in the NFL okay and um whatever is going through your mind is what goes through my mind okay it's exactly what goes through my mind as well and we have this like we have to balance not crushing their hopes but also being realistic right do you know what I'm saying okay good that's what I have to deal with as moms as as parents um in fact just one day you'll be parents and children are gift from us from the Lord and how we Steward our children is really the Crux of parenting and to help them discover their god-given gifts calling and and to enjoy that process together as parents that's one of the great privileges that we have as moms and dads that you will have if you become moms and D moms and dads yourself to Steward your children towards that goal so we're still on the journey if it's in football praise the Lord let it happen Okay but you all know what I'm saying right I'm 5 foot 6 okay that's all I need to say um you'll hear at times from Children Well I want to be this or I want to be that or on the flip side I want to be that guy I want to be that guy sitting on the sidewalk and is spinning these cool signs saying you know get your house over here that sign looks so cool the way he's flipping it over his head you know you guys what I'm talking about some kids have said when I grow up that's what I want to do in life and you're like okay anyway praise the Lord for people who do that okay um my daughter you know one thing I haven't heard from my my sons is like I want to be a pastor like never comes out of their mouth yeah never that's not even in in their mind okay but my daughter will come home at times and she'll say when I grow up I want to be a teacher just like Mom okay it's like oh good and then there are times when she's taken I think a lesson in US government or they've talked about politics as a class and she'll come home and saying I want to be the president of the United States of America and the same thing happens as a parent okay let's balance the hopes and dreams but also reality check and as I thought about that I think it's just human of all people all class all culture I don't know if you agree with me or not but I I IM imagine people of all yeah background thinks about a more hopeful future and I I thought of Queen vashi from that point of view that as a little girl growing up that she also dreamt of something wanting to become someone I'm putting Queen vashi kind of in normal human light but in a good light but she also had the dream to I want to benefit those around me I want to benefit my family I want to benefit the people of Persia I want to get to a position of influence and if it means that I dream to become the most powerful woman in all of Persia to become the queen of the king himself that's what I want to become I just kind of imagined this young girl growing up now we're living in a Time Esther's time was time of arranged marriages it wasn't like falling in love having courtship dating and then getting married it was arranged marriages so most likely she came from a family of dignity royalty perhaps of influence that she already had that background with her I'm assuming that she had all the Privileges of Education fortunately as king xeres would describe she was also very beautiful as she matured and became a woman so beautiful in fact one day King xers the parent King Darius and others come together and he finds her attractive wanting and they are mared and so this little girl's wish growing up wanting to become a person of influence and dignity wanting to help other Persians wanting that position perhaps a little bit for herself but really for the Ben benefit of others finally gets to achieve her dream and is now married to the most powerful man and she herself has become the queen of all of the Persian Empire she had good days where she exerted her influence as a queen to benefit people to benefit the citizens then she had some bad days just like anyone else would and the worst days are the ones that we're reading about today and her husband trying to gain military and political alliances trying to align them would throw Banquets and lavish parties and become so drunk that on this day he would send seven unic seven unic beckoning her to come so that all men who are drunk out of their mind already acting immorally would gaze upon her beauty now I gave a little bit of the cultural background that it wasn't a place for a woman of royalty and dignity to be around a situation like that in fact the only women who are allowed into a place like that where the men were drinking in High Spirits were actually the women from Herms it was the prostitutes the only females I were allowed into these kind of settings were actually prostitutes and now here comes the seven Unix mean bisa harbona Biga ABA zor and carcass the seven Unix who come to say the king bids you to come um one of the Jewish uh ancient Jewish commentators they talk about why did the queen say no the text doesn't actually explain to us why the que Queen refuses to come it may have been the cultural understanding that that's not a setting for me that's only meant for prostitutes the Herms the king's um the women that belong to the king's Heron but this Jewish rabbi goes on to explain this sentence to bring him Queen vasi wearing her royal crown in order to display her beauty to the people people and the Nobles when you read that the Jewish rabbi explains what it meant was for her to come only wearing her crown and nothing else completely nude completely naked so that these men who are already drunk out of their mind who are already acting grossly and immorally with the prostitutes would now look upon the queen fully naked wearing just the crown on her head this is men acting completely lustfully so you imagine why did the queen say no all she wanted was dignity from birth what she really dreamt for was not power but dignity to be held in high esteem and using that place and position to be able to bring good influence to our people put a queen with a crown completely nuded in front of drunken men has complete makes a complete mockery doesn't matter what she's wearing on her head that Crown means nothing the only thing she has has remaining is her dignity she knows when she refuses the king's edict the king's order the King's Command that's it she understands the consequences she loses everything but the one thing that she's always wanted was her dignity I was actually looking this up and there's a website called biblestudytools.com and one of the writers actually point to this her decision to disobey the command cost her everything except except the one thing that God gave to every single one of us and that is the image of God that gives each and every single person regardless of gender regardless of class regardless of our background dignity and only God can give that and here he is King xeres mocking it and taking it away I even find it very interesting that the Unix are named Unix are slaves they're lower class how many Unix names do you know in the Bible I searched the only time Unix are named is actually in the book of ES there's a famous unic that you may be aware of in the book of Acts where the Ethiopian unic who makes that Tre to Jerusalem to the God-fearing unic on his way back he meets philli and he's baptized so I even went to acts n just to see if that unic was actually given a name no name was given it's just the Ethiopian unic he remains nameless to us but here the writer of Esther interestingly takes precious ink and writes seven names down which really mean nothing to anyone they're slaves not only slaves overseeing a Haram they're castrated slaves you want to take the Dignity of men away castration would be one clear way of robbing a man of their dignity so that they would serve in the purposes of the king and overseeing a group of prostitutes I think the writer of Esther wants us to pay close attention to what's going on at this part where the queen says no enough is enough I in my mind again my imagination is all seven of you are here all seven of the king's Unix are here and as she recognizes them by name she understands that their dignity has been completely robbed that's what she's facing and she says no I not lose my dignity I'll lose my Throne I'll lose my crown I'll lose everything but I will not give up my dignity so that's the conflict we slow down and we're paying attention to what the writer wants us to see as we continue in this book um here's the resolution and the reasoning behind the resolution since it was customary for the king to consult experts in matters of law Injustice I had to almost laugh at that experts in matters of Law and Justice so here's the king he's angry he's mad so he's like I need to talk to The Experts of Law and Justice well let's say let's see what they come up with he spoke with the wise men who understood the times and were closest to the king these are Kina shiar Eda tares Maris Marena mukan the seven Nobles of Persia and media who had special access to the king and were highest in the Kingdom okay these are very special people members of the cabinet if you will according to the law what must be done to Queen vashi he asked she has not obeyed the command of the king xeres that the Unix have taken to her then Micon one of the experts of Law and Justice and that's the irony right there Then Mican replied in the presence of the king and the Nobles Queen vasi has done wrong not only against the king but against all the Nobles and the people of all the provinces of King xeres for the Queen's conduct will become known to all the women you can't have that what she has done her refusal to obey the king will become known to all the women so that they will despise their husbands and say King xeri commanded Queen Vash to be brought before him but she would not come this very day the Persian and the median women of the nobility who have heard about the Queen's conduct will respond to all the king's Nobles in the same way right there will be no end of disrespect no end to Discord if the queen is doing that to the king there goes the rest of us now every wife in every household will be doing the same thing and the news of this what the queen has done will travel all throughout the 127 provinces and that will be the end to family unit and so Micon the expert in law and Justice what does he come up with he's it goes on to explain therefore if it pleases a king this is his Bri bright idea let him issue a Royal Decree and let it be written in the laws of Persia media which cannot be repealed that vashi is never again to enter the presence of King xeres so she's lost a kingdom she's lost her position and she knew it and let the King give a royal position to someone else who is better than she then when the king's edict is proclaimed throughout all his vast realm all the women will respect their husbands from the least to the greatest does that make sense because of this fearful law of what's happening with Queen all the women will fear and respect their husbands anyway that's his bright idea and in verse 21 the king and his nobles were pleased with this advice he thought it was a great idea and so the king did as Micon proposed and he sent dispatches to all the parts of the Kingdom to each province in its own script and to each people in their own language proclaiming that every man should be ruler over his own household using his native T tongue so 127 provinces there were lots of languages being spoken and so he issues a decree that in every language that this decree should be written that all wives should be subject to their to their husbands we have to catch the irony here maybe a little bit subtle but for the Jewish community that is listening I think they're laughing like he did what the idiot did what those are the wisest people in all of Persia cuz the irony here was it the the fear was that the news of one woman vash's refusal is now going to spread throughout the land remember he was trying to align all the Nobles everyone to his side and if his Queen if his wife won't even listen to him how is it that anyone else will listen to him and so mukan thinking about this fear says why don't we write a law and send it out to all the 127 provinces punishing Queen vashti for what she has done you know what the irony is no one would have known this happened it could have been just kept just in house Unix weren't going going to talk and even if they did Unix have no right to tell story they their testimony is not even valid the king could have kept it just there and acted wisely perhaps patiently but the foolishness of this is now all 127 provinces has heard what took place and is full made fully aware what queen bash has done of course they know the edict but they know already they know now that wow maybe king xeri is not isn't to be that feared even his wife doesn't fear him so that's the irony that's the twist here and what the writer is interjecting here is the foolishness and the Folly not only of the Persian Empire the Persian king the best and the wisest that the Persians can produce the Folly when there's utter recognition there there's lack of recognition there's lack of recognition of human dignity when their idea of justice and the matters of the law they pass is so ridiculously injust I just bring two caution I just Proverbs that speak into perhaps this kind of a situation if we're ever in a situation where we've been greatly offended it says a wrathful man stirs up Discord but the one slow to anger calms Strife remember Micon was afraid that this was going to cause great disunity in families but here the wisdom of God says just slow down don't go too quick with with your wrath with your Fury with your anger another one a person's wisdom yields patience and it is to one's glory to overlook an offense an offense even to the highest one with the highest power we are living in a place where we're easily offended and when we're easily offended it leads us to behaviors to reaction and apart from God's wisdom apart from knowing how patience and wisdom and other things should be guiding Us in those tricky situations we can often fall into the trappings the foolishness as we see in King xery's situation and that's the point Esther is trying to make in this first conflict the conflict that arises because queen says no and the resolution that is put forth is folly is foolishness is the most ridiculous thing that they could have put out now the whole Kingdom knows now the all of the provinces are fully aware of King X's weakness when a king when the queen can just say no to him now let's try to bring this home a bit um it's not that I want to get political and I won't I think we have opinions when certain ordinances or laws certain justices or judges are um appointed we hear of certain laws from either our community or other states or other cities being past and we have strong objection or opinion based upon our understanding our life our values and everything that drives us that's times from a Biblical perspective from a Biblical world view it may seem that certain laws either favor people who follow Jesus or make it difficult for people who follow Jesus I speak not to get into a debate about any of the laws that are being discussed that are coming up to Supreme Court but to maybe the hearts and the fears and the worries and the concerns that people may have when certain things get passed because I've heard people say oh my goodness I can't believe they just passed that law oh my goodness I can't believe they just appointed that Justice oh my goodness our world is falling apart oh my goodness it's over I hear things like God this is why I don't want to have children I don't want to raise children in this Godless society and all kinds of things R come out of our mouth I think what Esther's Point here is in chapter 1 is pointing to us is yeah at times it may be Folly it may be foolish it may not be to the interest of God's people but does that mean God has abandoned us God has forgotten us does that mean God is no longer in control that the control has been given completely to those who make and control these decisions who elect the official wherever the control May lie are we in a place of Despair and cynicism and hopelessness or can we still see as the Book of Esther reveals that God may not look like he's visible his name is not being mentioned but he is present I think the key passage here is it actually comes out of mean's mouth mukan says let the King give her royal position to someone else who is better than she let someone else be in place other than Queen vashi we'll banish her but we'll find someone better that's the setup for the Book of Esther that's the setup for second chapter and Esther enters the scene without even knowing it mukan is actually depicting what God is doing behind the scenes to bring Queen Esther into that right place for a Time such is this you know reading through the Book of Esther considering what's going on in our context today I hope this book if it doesn't comfort you at least reassures you God hasn't lost control that he in his goodness with all of his wisdom will carry out his purposes to the end this book is a book of satire Jewish humor um it may not be that we're laughing but I I do think at times if if we were more Jewish and if we had more of a hebraic thought process I think there would be times in this book where we would just kind of burst out laughing I think when mukan brings forth his rationale and shares that decre the law and the King accepts I think that's one of those moments where the Israelite Community would just burst out laughing do you know that passage God laughs you know there's a verse there's a Psalm that tells us that God actually laughs and God laughs because it's actually somewhat humorous not in a mean way not in a this kind of a belittling way but it's actually this idea that is humorous it is humorous when kings and other Governors and leaders the world leaders think the world is under their control and they're going to take matters into their own hands and act and pass and enforce certain laws that they deem as just they deem to be good it's not that the Lord is far and laughing from afar but looking upon these leaders who take themselves so seriously Psalm says he laughs he scoffs because ultimately he's the one carrying out his good purpose I was hoping we can read the the psalm together as we wrap up this uh chapter um chapter one uh chapter one of Esther I was hoping we can read Psalm 2 together this is the psalm 2 that describes to us the Lord is sovereign and even when leaders come up with all kinds of ridiculous and silly and and laws that are Folly I'm sure it should concern us sure we should have some reaction to it but the Baseline heart of it is to still trust in God who is Sovereign so let's do this reading and let's do it in kind of a a way it would be done at a lurgical church I know we're not a high L lurgical church but this is where we can have a response reading so I'll read verse one you read verse two and so forth I'll go to three so I'll read all the odd verses and the congregation the church family you read the even verses can we do that we did that during passion week and I thought it was really cool and so we'll go through it and we're not speed reading we're reading thoughtfully we're reading to engage and understand what the scripture says sometimes it takes once or twice but we'll read it at least once okay so I'll read verse one why do the Nations conspire and the peoples plot in vain Earth R together let us break their chains and throw off their shackles here it is he laughs and he scoffs God has a sense of humor here okay he rebukes them in his anger and terrifies them in his wrath saying I will proclaim the Lord's decree he said to me you're my son and today I have become your father you will break them with the rod of iron and you will Dash them to pieces like pottery and serve the Lord with fear and celebrate his rule with trembling okay serve the Lord with fear celebrate his rule with trembling that tension that there is this fear fearful trembling at the worst things that are happening to you and yet you can celebrate but the Jewish people who have gone through tremendous amount of persecution and hardship they can still let loose go berserk the Book of Esther it mixes l after with fear and telling about a near tragedy that is tellingly reminiscent of actual tragedies the whole genocide all of the Jews their next were on the line and we laugh at the confused sexual politicians the Corky Emperor and above all the the ludicrous self- glorifying self-destructive villain hmon we're going to meet hmon boo hmon okay we're goingon to meet that guy later now humor is a device for diffusing fear and the author teaches us to make fun of the very forces that once threatened and will again threaten our existence and thereby make us and thereby makes us recognize their triviality as well as their powers Jews have learned that kind of laughter the Book of Esther begins a tradition of Jewish humor I know it hurts when you're going through times when it just seems as though God is not there absent almost uncaring and yet strangely The Mystery of the Gospel is something overcomes our hearts knows the outcome of where a good God is taking us on a journey we can actually laugh at it because of how trivial those things those circumstances those issues maybe even those laws are compared to God's control I don't know what that's going to look like I I see this have you seen people who laugh cry you've seen people have you ever laughed cry you're like crying you're laughing you're crying you're it just kind of okay that's strange something weird is going on okay sometimes that happens in movies sometimes that happens in weird scenarios and I think this speaks to much something much more something deeper than that that there is this Resolute confidence and the joy of the Lord knowing even in the place where God seems absent completely not there the world is turning upside down what is going on what what is happening to our society that we can remain steadfast the story of Esther reminds us God is there I hope as we look at the 10 chapters that we continue to be reminded of a God who is present amen amen okay worship team would you come forward and lead us into a response song can we have a our prayer time Brian
