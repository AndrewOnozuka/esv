morning morning I'm dressed up if you're wondering why I'm dressed up because I don't usually wear suit and Tha but we had a small um promotional ceremony in the first service and so our uh how many were there Sandy six um preschool kids or seven okay we have five today so six um preschool kids are being promoted into Elementary we had two students from element going now into junior high and then we had one Junior higher going into uh high school and so we recognized them and celebrated with them that's why I wear a suit I was trying to find a gown but I think my mom gave away my uh my gown it's gone I I don't know what happened to it my wife told me she gave it away that was such a nice gown [Laughter] too um also uh if you're friends with uh Emerson Pastor Emerson and um Annie if you know them I know some of you are new there are uh there are people co-workers that we've sent to East Asia and uh he will be ordained he will be ordained on the first Sunday of July and so I do believe that it will be on Zoom uh we'll send out the link uh so it's our Saturday night uh their Sunday morning where he will be ordained so if some of the family from chyos as we have sent them uh could join in that would be wonderful we'll get all the information out to you for that um and then the last thing um Esther Esther chaen recommended I do this so I'm doing it under her uh recommendation which I think was wise we're going over Esther chapter 7 we've been on the Book of Esther series and we've gotten to really the Crux of the book this is the twist in the story I I titled it the the Moment of Truth this is is where really the things turn um but there is a scene there is a scene in this chapter that may be shocking the NIV translates the Hebrew word molest molest and so I am going to read from the text uh but she did just tell me recommend that I I just kind of throw that as sort of a disclaimer um beforehand before we go into um what's going on in chapter 7 okay okay just as a more of a pastoral concern if words like that or the scene that we are about to look at um yeah may be very appalling and shocking okay all right so uh we've been on Esther series and today we come to Esther chapter 7 uh the Moment of Truth this is where uh Esther's identity what hmon has been really scheming for all of that stuff is about to be revealed this This Is The Moment of Truth and In This Moment of Truth I I want to take the opportunity then as uh we learn in reformed circles and reformed theology that in all of old and the New Testament um present Christ see Christ see the good news of who Jesus is in all passages in all sections sometimes it's a little bit harder more difficult doing that but I think today's chapter clearly um show shows us how we can see Christ even in the Old Testament in Esther chapter 7 so last week in Esther chapter 6 we started looking at the beginnings of hmon hmon is the bad guy he's the antagonist he's a guy that we want to hate that you know we just think of him as the most despicable human being um we see the beginnings of his downfall chapter 6 was actually very comical um we laughed at some sections of it of the chapter we left and and the way hmon um and he wanted to really humiliate morai he wanted to execute morai the Jew uh but what ended up happening in chapter 6 was there is kind of a small starting point of the Turning of the story where he himself was debased and humiliated and morai actually became honored in all of Susa uh he had remember constructed a pole that was about 75 ft and that's hard to kind of Imagine about five to six stories tall so you you have to imagine this pole is going way up into the air just to impale and execute and kill one man he wants to humiliate all of the Jews in this person of morai but what ends up happening rather than ging permission to do that he actually ends up parading morai on the king's horse wearing his robe and praising and heaping Praises upon the man he hates so much and so that night and kind of imagine if you will those are one of those days like where you come home you had you say to your wife or to your family I had the worst day at work that would have been like I had the worst day of my life at work and he's coming home dejected nothing that he had planned had gone to fruition instead he ends up being human humiliated and so he's trying to talk to his wife fully dejected and being kind of a superstitious culture even the wife and haymon's friends his advisers are saying oo this was the wrong fight this is a bad sign something bad is about to happen to you they kind of give him a little bit of a warning to hmon like you shouldn't have picked the fight with the Jews and it's in that that moment at the end of chapter 6 a couple of the king's attendants they come to Hon's house and Esther Queen Esther is now throwing the second banquet that she had planned scheming the outcome of what we're about to see and so hmon I kind of imagine you know he's being invited by the king and the queen he just had the worst day at his office at work and so why not blow off some steam a bit at a party why not go to the Queen's residence and as wine and foods are being served just be able to blow off just kind of a bad day perhaps that was going on I think there's a little bit more to it than that so we're going to look at chapter seven of what happens to hmon the day after his worst day at work so the king and hmon went to Queen Esther's banquet and as they were drinking wine on the second day the King again asked Queen Esther what is your petition and it will be given you what is your request even up to half the kingdom it will be granted so as hmon and King xeres is coming into Queen's residence and she's got this lavish party lots of drinking going on by the way drinking had to be part of a Persian party and the purpose of drinking was to actually get the guests intoxicated to get tipsy and just even fully drunk and so Esther is purposefully scheming and devising these plans to plea for her people under the right circumstances if you will she's shrewd she's a smart woman and she knows that these men cannot say no to alcohol and once the alcohol has gotten into their bloodstreams they'll be tipsy they'll be a little bit disoriented just they're kind of like in a way in this vulnerable foolish place and that was part of her plan Esther's been like in some sense for months now planning for this she's been patient there's sense of fear and anxiety in her heart because she does not know how this whole event will process out all she knows is there's a law the law of the land that at the end of the year on on that part particular day that everyone in the Persian Empire has been given the green light to ask if you're a Jewish descendant if you're Jewish then they have the right to execute you on spot and take over whatever it was that you owned property um whatever it may be it belong to them and so you have to imagine there's an intense fear that that Esther morai the Jews are still carrying in this moment she has no idea how anything's going to turn but a lot of the pressure in some sense of this injust edict this injust law rests on her shoulder and God is not leaving it just for her to figure it all out we've been looking at a series of coincidences that just line up so perfectly that even with Esther's great planning she couldn't have carried it all the way to full fruition and the point of the theological point of Esther is even though God's name is never mentioned at one at one point in the whole story that God is driving mysteriously invisibly but providentially purposefully intentionally involved in every step and just you before I move on in the face of Injustice that we face today in the face of Injustice that we face today the things that we hear about that God still partners with people as we shrewdly wisely patiently partner with God to confront those things I think Esther gives us a great example of a woman with dignity who partnered with a God who is invisible who almost seems absent but partnering with him every step of the way and confronting the greatest Injustice against the Jews in that moment in history I think that ought to encourage us and see our place in our own historical time period um H again coming back to the story hmon obviously has ignored the advice of the wife and the friends and he's coming in he's intoxicated he's in a Tipsy mood and it is in this moment that the King asks once again Queen Esther what's your petition what do you want like you're throwing this party because obviously you want something from me you wouldn't have risked your life coming in Uninvited unsummoned you wouldn't have done that unless you really wanted something and remember Pastor Phil when he was preaching on the previous chapters he said this idea of even up to half my kingdom it is yours I'll give it to you it's not that he means it literally it's that he is like doting on her he's loving her once again he's like I am so infatuated I'm so in love with you I'll give you anything that's the heart and when you see that what Esther has cleverly done is she's reversed the pursuit think about it in the previous chapter when she needed to risk coming unsummoned risking her own life she was the one that needed to pursue the king but in this scene it's now the king pursuing the queen in your petition you told me there's a petition and and we were going to talk about it in the first party but you you didn't tell me what that was and all night all I could think about is my queen wants something my wife wants something what is it that she may be petitioning and wanting even up to my half my kingdom I'll give it to you what is it and so the second party he is going on here and that's the only thing again on his mind who's pursuing who now and there's again a great reversal reversal of things are happening the queen in a sense is holding the deck of cards in her hand and the king is saying what would you like there's a lot of clever just shrewd dignity planning on Esther's part here and this has finally ripened the Moment of Truth for Esther to say okay here's my petition so the Queen Esther then Queen Esther answered if I have found favor with you your majesty and if it pleases you grant me my life that's my petition okay the first thing is would you save my life CU my life is on death row K on no idea the queen knows it my my life is on death row so my petition is Grant me salvation and spare my people okay remember this whole time she had concealed she hid the fact that she was Jewish no one knew that only morai Esther maybe a few friends and family members they were the only ones but here is the Moment of Truth here's the great reveal and my people spare my people this is my request King you want to know my petition and my my request spare my life spare the lives of my people for I and my people have been sold to be destroyed killed and annihilated and if we had merely been sold as male and female slaves I would have kept quiet so can you imagine like Esther forming these words shaping each statement just one at a time that we've been sold to be destroyed and killed and the king is probably like huh what what are you talking I had no idea your life was even in danger I who's your people and so he's just probably doing a lot of asking and then Queen in her wisdom and in her dignity continues to Humble herself using the flowery language of respect and honor and dignity towards the king so look if we had nearly been sold as male and female slaves you know I would have kept quiet no such distress justifies disturbing the great king king you're so busy you have so many things going on you have greases to worry about you got a kingdom to run it's the most powerful Kingdom on Earth and why would I bother you with a petty request had we just been sold as indentured servants as slaves in this Empire I wouldn't have even bothered you with that there's a lot of Flowery respectful language that Esther is using in order to heighten the tension here and then King xeres asked Queen Esther who is he where is he where is he right next to you the man who dared to do such a thing and so she has heightened the tension of his curiosity you know he was doting on her wanting to just give her anything now he is concerned and he is really playing to the right set of the emotions um the whole idea of just background information uh and I I'll not two of them one now and one later but just the idea of slaves and it's not that bad I I I don't know how you read it I don't know how you look at it but you know thousands of years ago where more than 50% of the population in the Persian Empire are serving as indenture servant it was kind of normative just if you will it wasn't like this great uh the slavery that uh us had to go through it wasn't that Injustice to that level okay I just want to kind of make that clear so that's what Esther here is referring to okay but it still Riles up the king and he asks who is he who is this man you know where is he how dare do such a thing so at that moment what the king is thinking about is who put a price tag on my wife if my wife was sold right under my nose I would have known about it and not only sold as an indentured servant but sold to be annihilated killed executed kid destroyed who would dare put a price tag on my beautiful wife on my wife that I love and I dote on and when that question just comes out of the king's mouth Esther says an adversary an enemy not even hmon just vile hmon feel like she just crafted these words and she was ready to point at hon um I don't know this is where like sometimes reading the Bible and you get a little bit imaginative you the three of them are having a party they're having a banquet the King has been a little bit tipsy drunk doting on her now he's like really angry hymon is probably like what's up you know this is great we're having an you know it's passing me more lamb whatever they're they're enjoying the thing and then all of a sudden boom that vile Hyman now if you were like directing a movie in script do you have Esther pointing her fingers directly at hmon I I kind of okay I do you see Esther just that vile amen just speaking the words staying dignified humble so I I don't know how you would do it but in my version it does it's not from Bible but I see her saying this man is the man who has put a price tag on my head the Moment of Truth has come out um now everything is making sense she is a Jew and so the edict to eliminate all Jews includes now Queen Esther from a spiritual angle when we were going over chapter 3 we talked about how this is a demonic plan it wasn't just Hon's hatred for morai but there's also a spiritual element a spiritual realm a fight between the agagites the amalekites against the Israelites it had been a cosmic plan the Lord himself was engaged in this battle and if this plays out according to Hon's plan and he does eradicate all of the Jews and he's able to eliminate and completely kill genocide then God's Plan of Salvation that's what hmon is trying to get in the way of God's Plan of Salvation that through the Seed of Abraham through um the people of Abraham Isaac and Jacob would come the Redeemer the Savior for all of mankind so that's also going on but all the king can think about right there in that moment is how dare this evil hmon put a price tag on my queen so truth is out and when Esther is wisely crafting these words sold as slaves you know sold to be annihilated sold to be destroyed we may miss it as westerners but she's also throwing in this subtle truth that what hmon is really doing isn't just this Feud this angry Feud that wants to eliminate bunch of people he doesn't like what he's actually doing in the process is grabbing more power that that's what hmon is really after sure he hates the Jews and wants to get rid of them he probably has no idea there's a cosmic battle going on but what in his individual heart what he's really after I want the King's throne I will not rest until that Throne is mine remember last chapter he had devised his plan of wearing the king's robe riding on the king's horse those things that he had fantasized about hmon had fantasized about they were the things that represented the Throne of the king but when you are given the signate ring and in charge of eradicating completely eliminating 2 to 3 million Jews where do all the properties go where do all the things that they worked hard for what what ends up happening to that well the guy who sold the guy who came up with the plan he gets to be the owner of all that that's implied in this and if you are the owner now of two to three million people's properties and everything they had owned in the all of the Empire you're closer to the throne than before and the king is recognizing this too now the king realizes hey Heyman you and I we were drinking buddies you and I I trusted you remember King xeres had assassination attempts I would imagine anyone who's had assassination attempts against him or her would be very very anxious would not trust anyone next to him near him it would be suspicious of every single person but somehow hmon has schemed his way all the way up to this level where the king said here's my Signet ring let's drink together I trust you and so this moment of truth that Esther is revealing about Hon's schemes scheming for the throne putting now a price tag on the Queen's head and you can imagine the king is shocked his Tipsy is but he is shocked to the core so what does the king do the king got up in Rage he is insense he's angry he is so upset that he left his wine okay I like the way the author writes it he's again he he was getting tipsy intoxicated drunk now something sobering has just landed on his lap and so he just has to leave his wine and he went out into the palace Garden he needs some fresh air I got to think about this the best way I can but hmon realizing that the king had already decided his fate oh hmon knows he's been had he stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life just as the king returned from the palace Garden to the banquet hall hmon was falling on the couch where Esther was reclining and the King exclaimed will he even molest the queen while she is with me in the house and as soon as the word left the king's mouth they covered Hon's face okay this is that section that earlier on I talked about so the king needs to cool off he's shocked he's angry he's Tipsy he's drunk he needs to think straight um he steps outside and right in that moment hymon realizes I'm dead duck the whole thing has reversed now my plan was to eradicate all the Jews make sure they would not breathe again but now he knows that he's facing the death sentence of his own now in this scenario it's customary in the Persian culture when they're banqueting the royalties is banqueting uh we usually sit at a dining table table um but they're kind of reclining I don't know if you've seen old movies where they're sitting in kind of a sofa like chair and they're sort of reclining as they're eating and dining and so it's again the setup for the the evil vile hmon to rush to the queen he's probably like staggering he's like drank too much but he's kind of making his way to the queen to bake for his life and hymon really is you know the tragic antagonist right here in this moment but the Jewish literature they just want to keep making him the butt of the jokes um it's not in scripture it's not an inspired Book of Exodus but in other Jewish literature more like folktale they added one more detail where Angel Gabriel shows up right in this moment the invisible Angel Gabriel shows up and as hmon is staggering his way to the Queen the Angel just shoves her shoves hmon right on top of Queen Esther so he falls on top of Esther and he's like oh my goodness probably what just happened and then that's coincidentally the moment that King steps into the room okay so again hmon is kind of the butt of the joke I understand the tension but that's what's happening here and immediately the king exclaimed will he even molest the queen like literally in my own Palace in my own house as those words as that rhetorical questions comes out of his mouth Terror just covering the face um phrase is used now in King's mind one level she's my wife what are you doing man get off my wife like how dare you literally lie on top of her in my own house but there's another angle another element to this see the whole idea of Herms and concubines is foreign to us um and when we think about it we T typically think about like this Rich powerful King having a lot of women that he likes to sleep with for personal pleasure that's kind of the way we understand it now that's that is true however it also has political implications it also has almost one commentators would would write sacred sacred implication this is the King's sanctity it's his sacred place if you will and part of that is because he owns okay in that in that culture he owns all of the concubines and even the wife and sometimes in making treaty or alliances with the surrounding kingdoms the way in which you honor like kind of make a note is you would give or receive a concubine and so the fact that you had all these concubines actually symbolized it implied that you had a lot of peaceful Alliance this is my kingdom if you will this is my political aspirations and my Dynasty and that's why Herms were so sacred in that time in in Persian Empire so when you see so there was a lot of etiquette actually and policies on how to govern over harams so when you see hmon literally on top of his wife Queen it's not just the sexual immorality thing this has sealed the deal that what hmon has been really wanting is also the throne itself and so immediately this is treason execution that's what's going on here and the last the last irony the reversal sort of the twist that we see is in verse 9 then harbona one of the Unix attending the king said a pole reaching to the height of 50 cubits stands by Hon's house he had it set up for morai who spoke up to help the king and the King said impale him on it hmon so they impaled hmon on the pole he had set up for morai and the King's Fury then subsided so this is dark this is dark this is execution of hmon um I don't know if if you're following it as a narrative as a story this is where you're like yes you know just stick it to him but I get it like there's death involved so it's a little bit kind of muted but this is where hmon gets it um and the irony and the humor here is now a unic another low person in that kingdom is aware like that there's a pole over at Hon's place and it's reaching four to five stories tall how how does he know that is because hmon had a constructed so high he raises so high so everyone can see so even a unic who is behind the palace's walls and wouldn't know what is really going on in the outside world even he's aware at least there's a pole up there and everyone has talked about why is this pole up there well it's for morai so everyone is aware of it and look at the way he tells the king there's one by his house and it was actually set up for morai remember morai morai is the guy who saved you from the assassination remember that guy it was for him but and Heyman had it up there what do you think yeah this is just humor in this and the King says oh let kill himon on that thing and that's the final twist the reversal everything that morai the evil vile sorry hmon everything that the evil V hmon had planned been completely reversed and he is humiliated in front of all of Susa he has gone from the second most powerful person in all of Persia to now being humiliated as a model this is what happens when you're commit treason okay so that's what's going on the great reversal and so the moment of truth and this is where I want to take the moment to think about the good news of Jesus Christ so it feels like I'm shifting gear but I I hope to be able to build a connection so that when you read other stories in the Old Testament and you don't see Jesus Christ like clearly visibly mentioned but you see the themes the motifs the ideas who God is is and how God is same yesterday today and forever now we see God most clearly in the person of Jesus Christ but we see hints of who God is who Jesus is here in Esther chapter 7 and as I pose that um I'm sure you guys are thinking it too so I spent a day Pastor Phil and I we went for a Day to a pastor's conference this past week and um we received some great teaching and insight and one of the questions that one of the speakers asked in one word try to summarize the gospel how would you summarize the gospel in one word and so he asked a room full of pastors like you know to say something so I'm going to do that to you guys in one word summarize the gospel okay go anybody can shout in this room love truth hope amen did you say Amen Michael okay amen anything else just call it out Jesus Jesus okay see that's that's what I was asking that's what we were waiting for right I was waiting to get to Jes and not that the other words aren't Associated related to the whole gospel narrative the gospel story The Gospel truth um so we were going through all these lists and finally said Jesus and then the speaker paused yeah because in Jesus you get two words like yah Yahweh saves God Saves so anyway that's cheating but anyway we got to Jesus um I I I think it is so difficult to reduce the idea of the Gospel just to one word but if we had to if we really had to Jesus saves are Jesus's King I've heard Heaven is a free gift great god reigns so God forgives God saves Jesus saves have you seen t-shirts so all of these things captures the idea that's associated with the good news the gospel but Paul takes the gospel and he is so excited he want wants everyone to connect with this idea that we have all carried this rebelliousness and sin in our hearts from the day of our birth it's what was inherit imputed to us from the beginning we were unrighteousness and before a holy God there's no way we can get into his presence and death was the penalty because of our sinfulness and that's across all All Nations all people but because God so loved the world he loves his creation and he's always had a plan for Redemption he sends his one and only son the Triune God who loves us who wants us to be in that Fellowship sends the one and only son in human flesh in human form to die on our behalf and the death that we were meant for he takes it upon himself and offers us the free gift of eternal life but in doing so this whole idea we need to repent we need to acknowledge our rebelliousness we need to acknowledge that we are apart from God that nothing in life will be okay unless we can once again be connected to our father through the person of Jesus Christ and the good news is that God did all the work in making this reconciliation possible now Paul knows this he's identified what the gospel is he understands this to the core of his heart so he's writing letter after letter after letter trying to just declare this explain this share this good news with as many people as possible especially to the Gentiles because he's been with the Jews along he himself is a Jew but God has called him now to the Romans to the Greeks and to the people who speak different languages think differently kind of live in different culture so he is looking for metaphors of anything that he can land on to say oh remember you know that legal the things that happen in your legal courtroom it's called justification yeah that's what Jesus Does He justifies you and he imputes this new righteousness on criminals criminals come guilty and they have to work out of that state but guess what you don't have to do that anymore and you are Justified because Jesus and his work on the cross takes care of that for you Motif after Motif justification for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God and all are Justified freely you don't have to pay a dime the righteousness is given to you by his grace through the Redemption the payment plan that came by Christ Jesus you don't need to pay for it words like Redemption justification reconciliation adoption these have become in our day and age 2,000 years later great doctrinal systematic theological words for us to study and think about and they help us back then they were just common language there were just legal terms banking terms the things that just went on in Roman life and for Paul to get the good news that God wants to reconnect with you through the person of Jesus Christ he's using all kinds of metaphors comparisons to communicate that reconciliation for if we were God's enemies do you think the Romans knew something about enemies alliances territorial enemies and the ways in which they would be reconciled between Nation to Nations anyway but we were while we were still God's enemies we were reconciled to him through the death of his son and how much more having been reconciled shall we be saved through his life they would have understood that the wars that they've had the fights they've had maybe even personally and to use the language the motif the theme of being reconciled together between the two opposing forces adopt option the Romans especially the wealthy ones they were known to adopt adopt Sons especially into the families Paul is again noticing that observing the cultural norms and saying okay you know what it's like that God wants to connect with you it's like your adoption process the spirit you reive does not make you slaves so that you live in fear again rather the spirit you receive brought about your adoption to sunship everything that the owner the Master of the House the dad owns now is yours so much that and by him we cry ABA father you may have called him slave master you may have called him Lord Master other language but now you can call that guy who adopted you Dad terms have changed because your status has changed that's part of the Gospel it is hard to reduce the word gospel to just one term Paul knew it so he gives us just Motif after Motif comparison illustrations metaphors so that no one can say that ah I I didn't understand it I didn't get it he is trying so hard to convey the truth the gospel element Motif that that I see in Esther chapter 7 is one of God being our savior rescuing us from the spirit of fear rescuing us because you have to imagine for the Jews and the Israelites and Esther and morai fear had gripped them for three months now three months ago the law had been passed that you are to be killed and they had about six seven more months remaining before that day would arrive and fear had gripped all of the Israelites in the Persian Empire and for chapter 7 to happen was a sign we have nothing to fear as long as God is the one who is in charge as sign as God is the one driving the story sure there is an enemy the adversary the vile hmon and the spiritual realm the enemy and the vile Satan is our enemy but what does Jesus Christ do against this vile Wicked creature whose only aim as John would tell us is to steal kill and destroy to annihilate the people the creation of God Jesus wants to offer life Jesus just as we see the victory the victory over hmon Jesus gives us Victory and I have four passages that we can just read together think about then afterwards I've asked our worship team let's sing the song um we're no longer slaves to fear um as part of our just ongoing thought and meditation on the good news of Jesus Christ two from the Old Testament two from the New Testament Isaiah 5417 no weapon that is fashioned against you no weapon no pole that was meant to impale you and kill you morai no weapon weon that is fashioned against you shall succeed and you shall refute every tongue that rises against you in judgment Isaiah 54:17 no weapons formed against you will succeed no lies no schemes nothing that the enemy does wanting to disrupt and destroy you will succeed we have that promise in the Lord Colossians chap 2 13-15 and you who are dead in your trespasses and the circumcision of your flesh God Made Alive together with him having forgiven all of our trespasses by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands then he set aside this he set aside nailing it to the Cross so the cross was where all the payment took place now verse 15 and he disarmed the rulers and the authorities and put them to open shame he disarms the rulers the authorities he lowers the abilities of the the hmon in your life and he puts them to open shame that Paul that was meant for morai now Hon's body is impaled bringing shame to the agagites to the amalekites the enemies of God and it is through Jesus that there is this triumphing over the enemy over them in Christ Jesus he brings victory in our lives Exodus 23:22 this is the Covenant he's making with the Israelites but if you carefully obey his voice and do all that I say God's voice if you carefully obey God's voice and do all that is said then I will be then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries yeah don't mess with God's people God is big he's a warrior king you pick a fight with God's people those people will be my enemies amen pick the wrong side 1 Corinthians 15 5556 and I I go to this passage from time to time you ever feel really low really dejected do you ever have those moments in your own spiritual walk where you feel defeated where you just kind of feel like giving up we'll hit moments like that in our spiritual journey this is the passage that I go to to meditate when those moments happen yeah oh death where is your Victory where o death is your sting it's kind of like yeah bring it on like bring your best Enemy Bring It On Buddy got God on my side and sometimes you need a jolt of confidence that it almost seems presumptuous and cocky but if it's going to be Cockiness in the Lord so be it bring it on buddy bring on your lies bring on all these thoughts that you're trying to get me down bring on your best that's what this is saying CU I stand confident in the Lord we on where old death is your Sting the sting of death is sin and the power of sin is the law but they than be to God he gives us Victory through our Lord Jesus Christ you know the verbage vernacular like Jesus Christ did not exist in Esther's time okay he was still to come thousands of years later but I could just imagine morai Esther thanks be to God the great reversal has just begun I am no longer gripped by fear and this man morai uh this man hmon has been put to death that's the good news for us in our spiritual journey and our spiritual battles that through Christ Jesus we have ultimately Victory there's a few more chapters of the Book of Esther um chapters 8 n and 10 they still have to figure out what to do with the edict it's still a law of the land and so Pastor Phil we'll preach on the last three chapters as I will be going on my sabatical and so Pastor Phil will Land This Plane and bring it home and continue on with the gospel message I've learned so much through the Book of Esther I don't know why I waited this long to preach through this book it's been so great and but Pastor Phil will finish um the Book of Esther three more chapters okay but this day let's meditate on the gospel the good news the good news that Jesus conquers over our enemies that we can be confident I pray that as we sing this song that the holy spirit will be near to all of us near to you in the areas where you feel like I've been failing I'm just really no good I feel like the Lord is telling me you know get this stuff together and all this is going on the Lord's voice and his assurances will come and remind you that we have victory in Christ Christ Jesus okay so worship team come up and let's sing this song
