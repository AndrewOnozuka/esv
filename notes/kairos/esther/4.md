## Sermon Information

## Historical Context
- Esther 4 takes place after Haman’s decree for the extermination of the Jews is issued (Esther 3:13).
- Mordecai, upon hearing the edict, publicly mourns in sackcloth and ashes at the king’s gate (Esther 4:1-2).
- Esther, still in the palace, is unaware of the crisis until informed by her attendants (Esther 4:4-5).
- Mordecai challenges Esther to intervene, despite the personal risk (Esther 4:8-14).
- Persian law dictated that anyone who approached the king without being summoned risked death unless the king extended his scepter (Esther 4:11).

## Summary of Chapter 4
- Mordecai publicly laments and urges the Jewish people to do the same throughout the provinces (Esther 4:3).
- Esther’s attendants inform her of Mordecai’s distress, leading her to send a messenger to inquire about the situation (Esther 4:5-6).
- Mordecai relays the details of Haman’s plot and urges Esther to plead for her people before the king (Esther 4:7-8).
- Esther initially hesitates, citing the Persian law prohibiting uninvited visits to the king (Esther 4:11).
- Mordecai reminds Esther that her position in the palace does not guarantee safety and that God’s deliverance will come with or without her (Esther 4:13-14).
- He delivers the famous challenge: “Who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this?” (Esther 4:14).
- Esther, moved by Mordecai’s words, resolves to act, requesting that all Jews fast for three days before she approaches the king (Esther 4:16).
- She accepts the risk, stating, “If I perish, I perish” (Esther 4:16).

## Key Themes & Lessons
1. **Recognizing Divine Purpose**
   - Esther is challenged to see that her royal position is not accidental but part of God’s greater plan.
   - This calls believers to recognize moments where they are called to act courageously for God’s purposes (Romans 8:28, Proverbs 16:9).

2. **The Power of Intercession and Fasting**
   - The Jewish people respond to the crisis with collective fasting and prayer, demonstrating the power of seeking God in times of peril (Joel 2:12, Matthew 6:16-18).
   - This emphasizes the importance of spiritual preparation before taking bold steps of faith.

3. **Overcoming Fear to Take a Stand**
   - Esther moves from hesitation to courageous action, embodying the call to stand for righteousness despite personal risk (Joshua 1:9, 2 Timothy 1:7).
   - This teaches that faith sometimes requires stepping into uncomfortable or dangerous situations for the sake of others.

4. **God’s Sovereignty in Human Affairs**
   - Mordecai’s confidence that deliverance will come, regardless of Esther’s decision, highlights faith in God’s sovereign plan (Isaiah 46:10, Daniel 4:35).
   - This reassures believers that God is always working, even when His name is not explicitly mentioned.

## Connection to Modern Life
- Every believer has moments where they must decide whether to stand up for their faith and values.
- Fear can paralyze action, but faith calls for trust in God’s sovereignty and provision (Philippians 4:6-7, Isaiah 41:10).
- Fasting and prayer remain essential tools for seeking wisdom and courage in difficult circumstances.
- God places individuals in specific situations for a purpose—recognizing and embracing this can lead to life-changing impact (Ephesians 2:10).

## Looking Ahead
- Esther’s decision to risk her life sets the stage for the dramatic unfolding of events in the next chapters.
- The effectiveness of her faith and strategic approach will be revealed as she steps into her role as an advocate for her people (Esther 5:1-3).
