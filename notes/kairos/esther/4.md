# Esther 4

## Sermon Information
- **Date:** May 22, 2022
- **Church:** Kairos Christian Church
- **Speaker:** Pastor Peter Yoon
- **Title:** Moving Towards Compassion

## Historical Context
- Esther 4 takes place after Haman’s decree for the extermination of the Jews is issued (Esther 3:13).
- Mordecai, upon hearing the edict, publicly mourns in sackcloth and ashes at the king’s gate (Esther 4:1-2).
- Esther, still in the palace, is unaware of the crisis until informed by her attendants (Esther 4:4-5).
- Mordecai challenges Esther to intervene, despite the personal risk (Esther 4:8-14).
- Persian law dictated that anyone who approached the king without being summoned risked death unless the king extended his scepter (Esther 4:11).
- The irony in this chapter is that Mordecai, because of his mourning attire, cannot enter the king’s palace, while Esther, inside the palace, is unaware of what is happening to her people outside.

## Summary of Chapter 4
- Mordecai publicly laments and urges the Jewish people to do the same throughout the provinces (Esther 4:3).
- Esther’s attendants inform her of Mordecai’s distress, leading her to send a messenger to inquire about the situation (Esther 4:5-6).
- Mordecai relays the details of Haman’s plot and urges Esther to plead for her people before the king (Esther 4:7-8).
- Esther initially hesitates, citing the Persian law prohibiting uninvited visits to the king (Esther 4:11).
- Mordecai reminds Esther that her position in the palace does not guarantee safety and that God’s deliverance will come with or without her (Esther 4:13-14).
- He delivers the famous challenge: “Who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this?” (Esther 4:14).
- Esther, moved by Mordecai’s words, resolves to act, requesting that all Jews fast for three days before she approaches the king (Esther 4:16).
- She accepts the risk, stating, “If I perish, I perish” (Esther 4:16).

## Key Themes & Lessons

1. **Recognizing Divine Purpose**
   - Esther is challenged to see that her royal position is not accidental but part of God’s greater plan.
   - This calls believers to recognize moments where they are called to act courageously for God’s purposes (Romans 8:28, Proverbs 16:9).

2. **The Power of Learning, Listening, and Lamenting**
   - One of the best ways to grow in compassion is through suffering that is out of our control.
   - The first posture of compassion: **Learn** – Understand why there is an outcry from suffering individuals or communities rather than making assumptions.
   - The second posture: **Listen** – Esther listens to Mordecai’s plea, becoming aware of the suffering that she was initially unaware of.
   - The third posture: **Lament** – Esther chooses solidarity with her people by fasting, a biblical expression of mourning and intercession (Joel 2:12, Matthew 6:16-18).

3. **Overcoming Fear to Take a Stand**
   - Esther moves from hesitation to courageous action, embodying the call to stand for righteousness despite personal risk (Joshua 1:9, 2 Timothy 1:7).
   - This teaches that faith sometimes requires stepping into uncomfortable or dangerous situations for the sake of others.

4. **God’s Sovereignty in Human Affairs**
   - Mordecai’s confidence that deliverance will come, regardless of Esther’s decision, highlights faith in God’s sovereign plan (Isaiah 46:10, Daniel 4:35).
   - This reassures believers that God is always working, even when His name is not explicitly mentioned.

5. **The Call to Use Privilege for Others**
   - Mordecai appeals to Esther’s responsibility in three ways: **her identity, missed opportunity, and privilege.**
   - **Her Identity:** Being Jewish would not protect her inside the palace.
   - **Missed Opportunity:** If she refused to act, God would bring deliverance through another means, and she would miss her role in His plan.
   - **Privilege:** Esther had resources, access, and a voice to advocate for those who did not.
   - This mirrors the biblical call for those in positions of influence to use their voice for the vulnerable (Proverbs 31:8-9, Isaiah 1:17).

## Connection to Modern Life
- Every believer has moments where they must decide whether to stand up for their faith and values.
- Fear can paralyze action, but faith calls for trust in God’s sovereignty and provision (Philippians 4:6-7, Isaiah 41:10).
- Practicing compassion requires **learning, listening, and lamenting** before taking action.
- Fasting and prayer remain essential tools for seeking wisdom and courage in difficult circumstances.
- God places individuals in specific situations for a purpose—recognizing and embracing this can lead to life-changing impact (Ephesians 2:10).
- True compassion is not about fixing people but standing in solidarity with them.

## Discussion Questions
- Do you struggle with practicing compassion? How do you typically respond when others are in pain?
- How often do you make an effort to learn about those in anguish before forming opinions?
- When was the last time you sat down to lament with others in pain rather than trying to offer solutions?
- How can you use your resources, position, or privilege to advocate for others, just as Esther did?

## Looking Ahead
- Esther’s decision to risk her life sets the stage for the dramatic unfolding of events in the next chapters.
- The effectiveness of her faith and strategic approach will be revealed as she steps into her role as an advocate for her people (Esther 5:1-3).

Esther 4 challenges us to recognize that we are placed in specific situations for a purpose. Compassion is not about offering quick solutions but about **learning, listening, and lamenting** with those who suffer. The question remains: How will we respond when faced with opportunities to act in faith and courage?
