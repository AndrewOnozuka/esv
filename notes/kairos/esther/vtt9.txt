good morning uh it's good to see you all um for those those of you that are new or visiting my name is Phil I'm one of the pastors here um Pastor Peter is currently on his sabatical so uh you'll be seeing a lot of me uh these next few weeks um but this morning we are wrapping up our Book of Esther series uh going through Esther chapter 9 and 10 and the title of the sermon this morning is how the turntables how the turntables now the reason I titled it this way is because one of my favorite TV shows is the office um you know some of you perhaps have watched it before but it's this American [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] check okay um you know what was I saying okay one of my favorite uh TV shows is the office right and this is American sitcom and one of my favorite characters is Michael Scott now he's played by this actor called Steve Carell and he does this wonderful job uh just this you know comedic character he's the boss of the office and U there's this one episode um for those of you that remember um he kind of Ventures off uh to do his own company right he leaves his original company called Dunder Mifflin and he starts his own paper company called Michael Scott paper company and in this company they're just kind of struggling to even get new clients but somehow through some shrewd and strategic moves they're able to to come to this place where the the bosses of the original company uh end up kind of extending a buyout to them and they're excited they go into the the office that they used to be part of and they say well and then Michael Scott says well well well how the turntables now you you know the saying is actually how the tables have turned but the reason I titled it how the turntables is because the start of this chapter actually begins like this it says on the 13th day of the 12th month the month of the edict commanded by the King was to be carried out on this day the enemies of the Jews who had hoped to overpower them but now the tables were turned and the Jews got the upper hand over those who hated them and immediately when I read the tables have turned I just you know I think I watched have watched too much office but my my mind just went there but the tables have turned right the great reversal has happened and we've been mentioning throughout this sermon series how there is a great reversal and as we come to this conclusion we see how everything that was meant to be has flipped upside down right in the beginning of the book the turmoil of the Jews was there where hmon had come up with this edict for the destruction of the Jews right it seemed like the enemies of the Jews had the upper hand they were given permission to kill and plunder uh the the Jewish people without consequence and so we see this kind of promotion of hmon who represents the enemies of the Jews and then all of a sudden we we we see that this great reversal right we see the quick downfall of hmon and we see the promotion of morai and now morai is the one who has the power Mori is the one who is clothed with the Royal garments morai is the one with the signant ring and last week we talked about this second edict that he issued and this second edict gave the Jews the permission to defend themselves against their enemies those that wanted to cause harm to them there's joy and celebration amongst the Jewish people people as their death as their Destiny no longer had to be death and destruction but rather it could be full of hope life and prosperity well well well how the turntables the great reversal has happened now I start off this chapter talking about reversals because this whole chapter chapter n and chapter 10 is couched in the great reversal see the 13th day of the 12th month has arrived and now the tables have turned the first edict has been countered the destruction of the Jews has been rerouted and the mour that was in place had turned into feasting see this whole chapter is a reversal of the course or the direction that it once was it was a a flip of what was supposed to be and this morning keep that in mind as we go through this chapter because the three points that I want to cover is the the reversals that happen first the clashing edicts second the success of the Jews and finally the Feast of purum you know last week we read about the second edict that goes out and if you weren't with us the second edict has gone out into the land so now the land is U governed by two edicts right again the first edict comes out in Esther chapter 3 it's the edict where hmon comes up with this plan for the destruction of the Jews that the enemies of the Jewish people would be able to kill and plunder them ruthlessly and without consequence and so that kind of just threw the city into a frenzy and then last week we read about the second edict right that comes out it's devised by morai and Queen Esther and in this edict um they the Jews were given the right to assemble themselves to organize and protect themselves to defend themselves from their enemies now the edict and the counter edict are now in place two edicts that govern the land both happening on the same exact day now you would think that when the actual day arrived because of the second edict people would be reluctant to attack the Jews but as we read in today's passage that's that's not the case there are still those who are determined to destroy the Jewish people so let's read the first four verses says on the 13th day of the 12th month the month of Adar the Eda commanded by the King was to be carried out on this day the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them but now the tables were turned and the Jews got the upper hand over those who hated them the Jews assembled in their cities and all the provinces of King xerses to attack those determined to destroy them no one could stand against them because the people people of all the other nationalities were afraid of them and all the Nobles of the provinces the satraps the governors and the King's administrators helped the Jews because fear of morai had seized them morai was prominent in the palace his reputation spread throughout the provinces and he became more and more powerful so notice how after this second Eda goes goes out that the the Nobles the satraps the governors all the king's administrators are helping the Jews and yet even though that is the case there's still those who were determined to destroy the Jewish people one commentary explains that even though mori's decree permitted the Jews to gather and defend themselves it could not change the hearts of people who were motivated either by some dislike of the Jews or the simple Prospect of easy money to be gained from their destruction there's evidence inclues towards the widespread anti-jewish sentiment already within the Empire and even with this counter edict there were still those who were determined to attack the Jewish people it does not change change the hearts of the people so this Clash happens right the enemies of the Jews come and the Jews assemble and they begin to defend themselves and we read on in verse 5 that says the Jews struck down all their enemies with the sword killing and destroying them and they did what they pleased to those who hated them in the Citadel of Susa the Jews killed and destroyed 500 men uh they also killed and I'm going to skip the names but you can read it yourselves the 10 sons of hmon son of hameda the enemy of the Jews they killed the 10 sons and and then notice at the end it says but they did not lay their hands on the plunder they did not lay their hands on the plunder see the Jewish people they successfully defended themselves and we'll get into this a little bit but several times throughout these chapters it's going to say but they did not lay hands on their plunder signaling that they acted out of self-defense it wasn't some selfish gain or Motivation by greed that they attacked their enemies even though they were given permission but it was out of selfdefense you know the last two weeks we've been talking about how we are also people that have experienced the great reversal we once lived under the Edict of death and despair but now we are people that live under the Edict of Salvation Romans 5:6 says that just at the right time at the right time while we were still helpless Christ came to die for the ungodly and because of his sacrifice The Curse Of Death has been removed from those who had placed their trust in him at the right time while we were helpless Christ came to die for the ungodly but this morning I I want to make this point here because in the same way that the Jewish people had to pick up arms to defend themselves against the enemy who hated them we also have to pick up arms and defend ourselves against an enemy who hates us now who is our enemy well 1 Peter 5: 8-9 tells us who our enemy is and it says be alert and of sober mind because our enemy is the devil who prows around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour resist him standing firm in the faith because you know that the family of Believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kinds of sufferings so it's very clear that our enemy is the devil Satan is actually not a name but it's the Hebrew word the translation is adversary Satan is the adversary of God now Satan is also adversary of humanity because if you remember humanity is created in the image of God we are image bearers of God himself and because of that Satan is an adversary of humanity and so it's very clear Paul also talks about how we uh our struggle is not against flesh and blood but against the principalities the spiritual dark Forces our enemy is the devil who is like a lion prowling around seeking for someone to destroy and we talked about this a few weeks ago but even after this Edict of Salvation even though it's been issued we know that the fight still rages on and we need to be very clear about this because there's a spiritual battle at hand whether we choose to recognize it or not see Satan and his emissaries their full-time job is to destroy uh the people of God is to thr the plans of God there is a spiritual battle that rages on Ephesians chapter 6:1 says put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes and so even though we've received this GOP gospel that informs us of our ultimate Victory we would be naive to think that there is not an enemy who is still Waging War against us we still need to pick up the weapons of God to defend ourselves against um the the one who prows around looking for someone to devour can you imagine if the Jews after receiving this second edict they rejoice and then they do nothing about it they don't prepare they don't organize they don't you know train themselves so that they can defend themselves I mean we would look at them and we would say how foolish how silly how you've received this edict giving you permission to defend yourself and you didn't do anything about it we would look at them and we would be puzzled by how ill-prepared they were how foolish they were and yet that's actually the case for some Believers there are some believers who know about spiritual warfare but have not taken it seriously there are some who have heard of the importance of fleeing from the fleeing uh resisting the devil and fleeing from temp Temptation and yet at the end of the day have chosen not to heed the warnings they know about the spiritual warfare that rages on and yet they have not chosen to equip themselves so that they would be able to defend themselves and to that end we need to encourage one another to take the spiritual battle seriously we need to warn one another and admonish one another understanding that there is a spiritual battle that rages on and then there are immature believers who don't understand the nature nature of spiritual warfare now I don't mean to use the word immature in a negative sense but simply put there are people who have never been exposed to the Paradigm that there is a spiritual battle there are people who don't know that this is happening and to that end we must help them become aware of the equipment that they have to defend against the enemy we must help them understand that there is this spiritual battle that happens but we are able to stand against the enemy that we have the aid of the holy spirit that there is the prayer and the intercession of the Saints and finally there are those who are weak and vulnerable those who have been broken and worn down whether through circumstances or trials or just situations that they are just feeling so weary and tired and we need to in those cases defend those who are weak and vulnerable we need to stand up for we need to intercede for them and pray for them and and walk with them in these cases see it takes discernment to know how to help the different categories of people some may be in a season of weakness and vulnerability and if you were to treat them as one who uh were to just not be taking spiritual warfare seriously I think we would crush their spirit and be doing them a disservice on the other hand if you treat the one who has no Paradigm of the spiritual warfare the immature believer who doesn't know it's going on and if you treat them as one who is just weak and vulnerable you create this dependency where you're not not helping them become equipped for the battle that rages on but you create this dependency where they have to come to you to to be be helped and we don't want to do that as well and so we need to discern uh you know how how we're reacting to the spiritual battle ahead of us and so my question this morning is do you find yourself struggling with spiritual warfare it's not just in those moments where we feel like things are going wrong see spiritual warfare happens all the time it's the enemy's desire to to make you question can you really trust that God is good just like in in in in the Genesis account did God really say that is God really good and this spiritual battle happens more often than we think it does but do you find yourself struggling with spiritual warfare are you weak perhaps you're in need of covering you're in need of prayer we have an intercessor prayer team that would love to pray with you are you you just immature you need people to help teach and equip you or are you not taking it seriously and sometimes we just need a healthy kick in the butt right not like a condemnation but come on this encouragement we need to take this seriously see all of us may be may be in different seasons or maybe struggling with different things but I pray that as a church we would mature in the way that we understand what is happening in in our midst the spiritual warfare that exists um in in our in our in our lives in our families in our church and in the world that we live in now last thing I want to say about spiritual warfare is that we're not only to defend ourselves against the enemy but we can be on the offensive as well right we know that we've been given authority over the enemy to just like the Jews they were given this authority to plunder the enemy and and in that sense if Satan is the one that has come to kill steal and destroy then Jesus The Authority that Jesus has given uh the followers of Jesus is to cancel the assignment of the enemy me see after Jesus rose again from the dead he said all authority in Heaven and Earth has been given to me therefore go and make disciples of all Nations baptizing them in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you surely I will be with you always to the very end of the age you're you and I are given Authority not just to stand firm against the tax of the enemy but actually if I could put it this way not just to play defense but to play offense as well can ing the assignment of the enemy see when we pray your kingdom come your will be done we are we in a sense we're we're asking that God would cancel the assign assignment of the enemy and that the kingdom of God would come forth where we are in San Diego we resist the devil we flee flee from flee from temptation but we also cancel the assignments of the enemy and taking back what belongs rightfully to uh the King of Kings Lord of lords so moving on from this edict um as we go on in this passage the second point I want to look at is the success that follows the Jewish people and as as we read in verse 11 says the number of those killed in the Citadel of Susa was reported to the king that same day the king said to Queen Esther the Jews have killed and destroyed 500 men and the 10 sons of hmon in the Citadel of Susa what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces now what is your petition it will be given you what is your request it will also be granted if it pleases the king Esther answered give the Jews in Susa permission to carry out this day's edict tomorrow also and let Hon's 10 Sons be impaled on poles so the king commanded that this be done and edict was issued in Susa and they impaled the 10 sons of hmon the Jews and Susa came together on the 14th day of the month of Adar and they put to death in Susa 300 men but they did not lay their hands on the plunder meanwhile the remainder of the Jews who were in The King's provinces also assembled to protect themselves and get relief from their enemies they killed 75,000 of them but they did not lay their hands on the plunder again this these reports are coming back in uh to the king the very same day and they they they mentioned that that they did not lay hands on the plunder so the so in Susa in the actual city um it was the edict was extended an extra day so the 13th and the 14th day of the month they were given permission to defend themselves against those who would cause them harm meanwhile in the rest of the king's province in the rural areas um all throughout the Empire uh the Jews organized and gathered together to defend themselves and it says 75,000 enemies of the Jewish people were were were killed um and so there's this Clash this Clash that's happening in the Empire on the 13th day of the 12th month and I want to focus on the success that comes with the Jews right just a few observations um that we can infer from their success but let me first point out this Motif that we've been seeing throughout the Book of Esther see this Motif is one of God Providence and of his sovereignty despite God's name not being mentioned specifically in the Book of Esther we see his fingerprints all throughout the story he is involved not just Loosely involved but intricately involved it says all the people of other nationalities feared them all the people of other nationalities feared them and this actually Echoes the Israelite account when they're leaving Exodus uh when they're going through the Exodus um if you remember as they're kind of getting into Jericho they send spies ahead to kind of spy out the land right if you remember Rahab comes to these spies and tells them that because they have heard all that Israel's God has done leading them out of Egypt parting the Red Sea even um that they were able to conquer these Kings of the amorites in this there's this recognition that Israel's God is doing something there is a divine intervention that is invol involved in in The Narrative of what is happening and in the same way as we look at the Book of Esther we see that the other nationalities fear them because they recognize that there's something that's going on there's a divine intervention there's something that's out of their control that impacts their success and so there's um so there's there's things that so what I want to kind of portray is there things that the Jewish people must do and that contribute to their success but there's also this Divine dimens there's this spiritual Dimension or there's this Divine Dimension where it's out of their control that also contributes to the success it's not just the works of their hands it's both and what what the Israelites do but also the involvement of God so with that said here just a few observations about their success the first one is very straightforward um it said they assembled right they organized they were United they had a common enemy and a common goal now I don't want to belabor the point but generally speaking being unified is better than being divided right while you know Unity isn't always the case that a team wins it's not always the case that a country wins a war but it certainly contributes I think to success now I want to talk about the church for a brief moment because I think one of the enem one of the tactics of the enemy is to sew division within the church to create distractions to conquer and to divide now a lot can be said on this I mean you know there's we could have a whole sermon on on the UN Unity of the church um but what what I want to say is that more than ever in this day and age we are seeing a divide within the church we are seeing uh not just the big the big issues that divide us but there's also interpersonal conflicts there's infighting there's miscommunication there's things that um that that that cause us to be bitter towards one another or have unforgiveness or slander or gossip and these are things that happen regularly within the church it almost feels like left alone division is the default where you have to work so hard towards Unity but the moment you stop um working towards that it just kind of falls into shambles now you know if you've ever mobilized a large group of people you understand that there are so many individual preferences right there's so many individual opinions about certain things there's so it's difficult to mobilize a group of people it's so hard to be unified because there's so much room for miscommunication there's so much room for hurts I mean there's so much um so much missed expectations individual ambition and preference that breaks the group apart and it's easy to just throw our hands in the A and say what's the point right it's just too hard to overcome but on the other hand I think when you've seen Unity how beautiful it is to to come together and to love one another another and to work together for the purposes of God's kingdom it's something that we even though we know it's not an easy task it's something that we need to desire it's something that we need to pursue and so can I say are you an intercessor are you a peacemaker are you one filled with wisdom or a leader can I just say you are so needed in today's climate you are so needed in today's climate you know one of the curriculum that we've adapted uh for our kyus 101 membership process is from emotionally healthy relationships uh by uh Peter and Jerry skazo and one of the reasons we think this material is important because um we we understand how difficult it is to grow in healthy relationships it's so difficult we can grow in our understanding of scripture we can grow in prayer we can grow in the ways that we we serve one another but one really important way we also need to learn how to to grow in is how to love one another and can I just say loving one another is not as easy as it sounds loving one another is more difficult than it seems right there are so many different habits that we have different backgrounds we come from different upbringings different communication Styles there's so many different ways in which we feel loved or in which we feel hurt there many ways that we uh we have commonalities but in that very same vein we have so much differences amongst us so much potential for relationships to blow up and so as our staff has been really thinking through how do we grow as a church that desires to love God and love people that's one of the reasons we adapted this material and we want to be a people that not only learns how to love God but to love one another as well see I believe one of the signs of maturity for a church is unity and healthy relationships and as I'm starting to prepare our next series which is on the uh on first John we're actually going to get into this a lot more um but the reality is the church cannot and will not mature without Unity again Unity not uniformity but Unity if I could just put it simply with a common goal and a common enemy our common enemy is Satan and his ad and his emissaries and our common goal is the Great Commission right to go to to to um to the Great Commission uh to to share with everyone uh to make disciples of all Nations wow I can't believe I just blanked on the Great Commission but to make disciples of all Nations right baptizing them in the name of the father Son and the Holy Spirit teaching them to obey all that Jesus has commanded that is our common goal we have a common enemy and a common goal and I pray that our church as we learn together as we grow together we would mature as one that desires unity in that way seeking God's kingdom here in San Diego on as it is in heaven now the next observation In this passage uh for that leads to I think the success of the Jews is that leadership actually matters right we look at morai verse 3 and 4 tells us that because of his position and prominence everyone comes to the aid of the Jews in fact if you look at chapter 10 we read more about his leadership he actually becomes second in rank to King xerses and he's preeminent among the Jews held in high esteem by his many fellow Jews because he worked for the good of his people and he spoke up for the welfare of all Jews now morai is not a military man in fact he is a politician he is a leader uh of the Jewish people he represents them and because he's this figurehead he actually helps propagate the success of the Jews and so I want to make a a point that morai is the leader for the Jewish people um that is is is spearheading this effort now you know these I I listen to a lot of leadership podcasts and uh these past two years I have not failed to hear uh in every one of these leadership podcasts that talks about how we are in a leadership crisis there are burnt out leaders there are um there are immature leaders there are hurt leaders corrupt leaders there are leaders that that because of how um our world is just changing so quickly uh they aren't able to Pivot and the organization is just just in in chaos and so I think we can see how leadership matters right we can see how where a good and healthy leader is in place it makes a world of difference but on the same hand unhealthy leaders can cause serious harm now because of mori's leadership and the favor that's shown him it propagates the success of the Jews and many of you are leaders in your own rights many of you are either leaders now or you are becoming leaders in your own fields and our prayer is that you and I would take seriously this call to to not only just be good leaders but to have character and in Integrity compassion and love wisdom as we go into our workplaces Desiring the the good and the benefit of the people that we are leading see Proverbs 29:2 says when The Godly are in Authority the people Rejoice but when the wicked are in power they groan and this is certainly true right we see in the Book of Esther that when Hon's edict comes out the city is thrown into a frenzy they are in there's chaos in the city but when Mori and queen Esther's EDI goes out it says the city rejoices the city shouts in Jubilation see we live in a day and age where suspicion towards leadership is high and there's certainly Merit in that because there have been so many scandals so many abuses of power and failure in leadership that there is reason to be cynical towards leadership but at the same time that does not mean that leadership is not needed see there's always going to be a vacuum for leadership and and a need for that and so I think what we can see is people benefit from having a good and healthy leader that leads with integrity and love for the people that they are leading now regarding our church leadership as I shared earlier um Pastor Peter is on his sabatical and can I just invite us to be active in praying for him and his family um not just when we are prompted to do so but earnestly praying that in his sabatical that he would not only receive rest but that he would would receive wisdom and discernment that he would have a deeper love for the people that he is leading that he have wisdom on how to lead this church and that in this next decade um I think he's like 53 or something as he kind of like takes this last decade um that there would be vision for how God is moving in this church and in this city and so can I invite you to pray for him and and in this summer please pray for me as well you know I I really need wisdom and uh discernment and um you know I'm not just asking that you know you would pray that everything would be good but honestly that there would be for me for myself as well a deeper love for the people that uh are part of this church that I would really grow in that as well now finally um this last point on the success of the Jews their own responsibility and you know I mentioned this earlier they knew the authority that had been given to them um to pick up the sword and defend themselves and so um again I want to mention this brothers and sisters you have the authority to defend yourselves against the attacks of the enemy you have that right to defend yourself because that battle continues to rage on I remember one time I was going through the Ephesians 6 chapter about the armor of God and as I was picturing the armor that has been given to us um you know I kind of pictured this case where the shield of faith that we pick up um you know it was like this really small play shield and there's these like huge flaming arrows coming from the enemy uh and then it's like trying to like defend the these arrows with this small play Shield it just does not work it doesn't happen and sometimes it can feel like that because we have not learned how to wield the armor of God we have not learned how to defend ourselves to equip ourselves and and as as as people of God do we take this spiritual battle seriously where we are maturing and learning how to wield the armor of God the sword of the spirit The Shield of Faith do we actually stand in agreement with the authority of Jesus that has been given to us now I'm not not saying that because you have trained it will be easy but have you set your mind on training and preparing yourself to resist the devil's advances have you picked up your Bible with the intent of training and setting your mind on the things above see if our orientation is wrong even with the authority that's been given to us we don't know what to do with it again when we look at the success of the Jews I want us to understand that it did not solely depend on the intervention of God God nor did it depend solely on the initiative of the Jews but it was dependent on both both and in the same way our fight against the enemy is dependent on both the sovereignty and Providence of God um but also our own responsibility as well the way we contend and orchestrate Unity the way we pray for and develop leaders the way we take ownership of the authority that's been given to us see these are responsibilities that belong to us that we ought to take seriously and though it doesn't always guarantee success I believe it certainly contributes to success in the time of battle now the Book of Esther wraps up with the explanation of the Feast of purum and so we'll skip down to verse 20 say morai recorded these events and he sent letters to all the Jews throughout the provinces of King xerses near and far to have them celebrate annually the 14th and 15th day of the month of Adar as the time when the Jews got reliefed from their enemies and as the month when their sorrow was turned into Joy their M into a day of Celebration and he wrote These to observe he wrote them to observe the days as days of feasting and joy and giving presents of food to one another and gifts to the poor so the Jews agreed to continue the celebration they had begun doing what Mari had written to them for hmon Son of Hema the agagite the enemy of all the Jews had plotted against the Jews to destroy them and had cast the poor that is the lot for their ruin and destroy destruction but when the plot came to the king's attention he issued written orders that the evil scheme hmon had devised against the Jews should come back onto his own head and that he and his sons should be impaled on poles therefore these days were called purum from the word pure because of everything written in this letter and because of what they had seen and what had happened to them the Jews took it on themselves to establish the custom that they and their descendants and all who joined them should without fail observe these two days every year in the way prescribed and at the time appointed these days should be remembered and observed in every generation by every family and in every Province and in every city and these days of pum should never fail to be celebrated by the Jews nor should the memory of these days Die Out Among their descendants so here we have an explanation of the Feast of purum and it becomes this national holiday that was to be remembered and observed in every generation every family every city every Province and the four main components of how they celebr is this there's the reading of the Book of Esther the night before and the day of that's the first the second is they would give money gifts to at least two poor people the third is they would give send gifts of two kinds of foods to at least one other person and and they would also have this extravagant Feast that included wine and other intoxicating beverages in other words they were celebrating it was a feast to be celebrated and as I was reading about this celebration um and this the purposes of these celebration that actually continue there's two noteworthy purposes that I want to focus on first it was a telling a retelling if you will of their Deliverance there is this retelling of the Deliverance story this recognition that God is intimately involved in their salvation even without the mention of his names again again that's one of the motifs of Esther that we've been pointing out that he's intricately involved in their welfare you know um in in in the Passover feast it was also a feast of Celebration and it was also a retelling of their Deliverance but in that that was more of a religious feast as it was celebrating their uh freedom from C uh From Slavery but this Feast the Feast of purum actually became more of a national National feast and that brings us to the second purpose uh which is to celebrate the identity of uh the Jewish people to celebrate their identity as Jews now if you think about for a moment the Book of Esther the context with it is that these are people that have been in exile for over 70 years they they had been given permission to go back to Israel but the ones that remained in this Persian Empire were the ones who actually had assimilated they had planted Roots they had gotten jobs they had grown and they become part of society and so when you think about assimilation it requires a watering down of your previous identification that that was held on to before I mean it's just the natural part of assimilation now this doesn't mean that they no longer identified as Jews but it certainly wasn't as strong of an identification marker as it would have been for previous generations so for me as a second generation Chinese American my ties to my ethnic Roots is not as strong as my parents and my children have even less ties uh to their ethnic um background than than I do and so it's natural in this process that people start to lose parts of their identification uh uh of their identity and so these Jews that had assimilated their identity as Jewish was still there it just wasn't as strong as before and when you read through the Book of Esther you kind of see this story arc of what's Happening um you would assume that when persecution comes they would completely disassociate from the identity but actually the reverse happens there is actually a revitalization a Rejuvenation of their NA national identity and so this Feast becomes one of national celebration because of their identity as Jews now I want to talk about us see last week we talked about the celebration that is entailed with being people that have received this Edict of Salvation see we too have a reason to celebrate because we have experienced the Deliverance of God through the blood of Jesus and yet we don't have feasts particular uh feasts that unite us right you know as churches we we do kind of focus on Christmas and Easter um but they're not really feasts that um that that that are kind of celebratory in that sense but I think one of the ways that we remember and celebrate our deliverance is through the Lord's Supper is through the sacrament of communion see one of the ways we can understand communion is that it also is a retelling of our deliverance it's a it's a retelling of the story of how we have been saved it's a Sacrament in which we remember that we too were once helpless under the weight of sin but because of the body of Christ the blood of Jesus that was shed for us we can come to the table experience this Covenant of Grace that while we were still sinners Christ died for us that's not by our works that saves us it's by Grace you know whenever we serve communion we give opportunity for people to reflect and to meditate and I know sometimes people are like I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do in this moment so let me encourage you one way to spend that time is to retell the story of Deliverance to remind yourself that you too were once under this Edict of death and despair but now you no longer have to live under the tyranny of sin because of what Jesus has done for you because of his extravagant Grace for you retell the story of Deliverance to yourself as you participate in the Lord's Ser supper another way we can understand communion is our identification as followers of Jesus as Christians as the body of Christ the family of God a few weeks ago I was listening to this podcast that was talking about uh the sacrament of communion and the early church they put the Lord's supper at the center of the service I mean nowadays we put the sermon as the centerpiece of the sermon but the early church actually the way they met together was to place this Sacrament in the center the the most important part of their worship service and it was it was not because of it's just taking the bread and you know sometimes we kind of come to the table we just take the the wafer and and the juice and we think we're just eating and drink of it but it was a holy participation it's a holy participation in the body of Christ and the blood of Jesus Read With Me 1 Corinthians chap 10: 16-1 17 says is not the cup of Thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ and is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ because there is one loaf we who are many are one body for we all share the one loaf see there's two things that is going on here as we partake in communion first there's a holy participation on our end with Christ the same podcast is talking about you know when we come to the table a lot of times we just think about our participation right how we are participating in uh in in the Lord's Supper but we don't think about how God is participating in it and so it was funny think like what do you think God is doing when you take communion like is he looking at you nodding in approval like yeah eat that bread yeah drink that wine or that juice or whatever it is no there is a holy participation in communion there's something sacred and divine that is happening as we partake in communion we are communing with Christ on the other hand there's also participation with one another in the last sentence says we who are many are one body and so there's this ident ification here where we come together to the Lord's table and that's one reason why when we do communion we actually ask that everyone hold on to the elements until the very end so that we can take of it together so that there is unity in proclaiming that we are followers of Jesus but we're also not only identifying with him in his death and Resurrection but we are identifying with one another because of the blood of Jesus we can belong to one another we are adopted into the family of God and not just this local church but the universal church the church that spans across generation we are in Fellowship because we are identifying that we are followers of Jesus and that is something that is hard to grasp and hard to imagine but that's what's happening as well as we come to the table to take of these sacraments and so those are two purposes that as we come to the table we're also retelling our own story of Deliverance we're also strengthening our ID identification ation as followers of Jesus um worship team you guys can come on up but you know our church typically uh receives communion the first Sunday of the month and you know it's the last Sunday of the month but in light of this teaching um just felt like it was best to kind of lead us into this time of communion it's not a hard and fast rule that has to be on a certain uh day of the month but as we um you know respond and worship and offering um we're going to enter the enter into communion after that and so let's um let's let's let's rise and we'll have the offering um offering prayer and then a song of response and then I'll come and lead us in a time of communion
