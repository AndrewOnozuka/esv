## Sermon Information
- **Date:** May 15, 2022
- **Church:** Kairos Christian Church
- **Speaker:** Pastor Peter Yoon
- **Title:** Haman the Agagite

## Historical Context
- Esther 3 takes place approximately five years after Esther became queen.
- King Xerxes promotes Haman, an Agagite, to a position of high authority (Esther 3:1).
- The Agagites trace their lineage back to King Agag of the Amalekites, historical enemies of Israel (1 Samuel 15:8).
- The Amalekites were the first nation to attack Israel after their exodus from Egypt, preying on the weak and vulnerable (Exodus 17:8-16).
- God commanded Israel to remember the Amalekites’ actions and to blot out their memory (Deuteronomy 25:17-19).
- King Saul failed to fully execute God’s judgment against them, leading to the continued enmity seen in Esther (1 Samuel 15:9-11).
- The conflict between Mordecai and Haman is not just personal but part of a larger cosmic battle, reflecting the spiritual warfare between God’s people and the forces of darkness.

## Summary of Chapter 3
- Haman is elevated to a position of power, and the king commands that people bow to him (Esther 3:2).
- Mordecai refuses to bow, citing his Jewish identity and history with the Amalekites (Esther 3:4-5).
- Haman, enraged, plots not just to kill Mordecai but to exterminate all Jews in the Persian Empire (Esther 3:6).
- He casts lots (Purim) to determine the day for the massacre, landing on the twelfth month (Esther 3:7).
- Haman convinces King Xerxes to issue an edict for the genocide of the Jews, presenting it as a way to rid the empire of disloyal subjects (Esther 3:8-11).
- The decree is sent throughout the empire, throwing the city of Susa into confusion (Esther 3:15).

## Key Themes & Lessons

1. **Spiritual Warfare and Historical Enmity**
   - The conflict between Haman and Mordecai reflects an ancient spiritual battle (Ephesians 6:12).
   - The Amalekites symbolize opposition to God's people, stretching from Exodus through Esther.
   - Satan actively seeks to thwart God's redemptive plan, using human opposition as a tool (John 10:10).
   - Haman’s casting of lots (Purim) was a form of divination, possibly seeking demonic permission to act against God’s people.

2. **Demonic Opposition to God’s People**
   - Haman’s genocidal plan is not merely political but spiritual, aiming to destroy the lineage of the Messiah.
   - Similar to Pharaoh in Exodus and Herod in Matthew, Haman represents Satan’s attempts to prevent God’s plan from unfolding.
   - The decree goes out on the day of preparation for Passover, an ironic reminder that God had previously delivered His people from oppression.

3. **Courage in the Face of Persecution**
   - Mordecai stands firm in his faith, refusing to compromise even under threat of death (Daniel 3:16-18).
   - This challenges believers to remain steadfast in their convictions despite cultural or political pressures (Acts 5:29).

4. **The Role of God's Providence**
   - Though God’s name is absent in Esther, His hand is evident in orchestrating events (Romans 8:28, Proverbs 21:1).
   - The seemingly random casting of lots (Purim) aligns with God's divine timing (Proverbs 16:33).
   - The Jewish people appear vulnerable, yet God's unseen presence ensures their survival.

5. **The Dangers of Power and Pride**
   - Haman’s unchecked pride leads to an irrational hatred and desire for destruction (Proverbs 16:18).
   - His actions illustrate the consequences of power without moral restraint.
   - The contrast between Haman and Mordecai highlights the difference between pride and humility (James 4:6).

## Connection to Modern Life
- Spiritual battles continue today; believers must be aware of opposition to God's purposes (1 Peter 5:8-9).
- Standing for faith may bring trials, but God's providence ensures ultimate victory (2 Corinthians 4:8-9).
- The rise and fall of leaders demonstrate the importance of humility and righteous leadership (Proverbs 29:2).
- The story of Esther reminds us to trust God even when He seems silent in our circumstances (Isaiah 41:10).
- Like the Jews facing Haman’s decree, persecuted Christians today need intercessory prayer and advocacy.
- Believers must be equipped for spiritual warfare, putting on the armor of God to stand against the enemy (Ephesians 6:10-18).

## Discussion Questions
- How often do you think about the spiritual realm and the cosmic conflict happening in the background? What comes to mind when you think about it?
- From this chapter, how do you see the sovereignty of God at play?
- The conflict between the Amalekites and the Israelites spans centuries. How does this fit into the larger biblical narrative of the struggle between God’s people and the forces of darkness?
- How do you approach conflict in your life? What's the right approach to understanding adversity and difficulties?
- How can you actively intercede for the persecuted Church today?

## Looking Ahead
- The Jewish community faces imminent destruction, leading Mordecai and Esther to take bold action.
- Chapter 4 will reveal Esther’s response and the call to courage in the face of adversity (Esther 4:14).

---

The unfolding events in Esther 3 emphasize the ongoing battle between good and evil. While the enemy schemes, God is always working behind the scenes to fulfill His plans and protect His people. The edict goes out a day before Passover, almost as a reminder that God has delivered His people in the past. Though He is not mentioned in this story, it is apparent that He is sovereign throughout the story.
