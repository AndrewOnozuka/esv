## Sermon Information
- **Date:** May 15, 2022
- **Church:** Kairos Christian Church
- **Speaker:** Pastor Peter Yoon
- **Title:** Haman the Agagite

## Historical Context
- Esther 3 takes place approximately five years after Esther became queen.
- King Xerxes promotes Haman, an Agagite, to a position of high authority (Esther 3:1).
- The Agagites trace their lineage back to King Agag of the Amalekites, historical enemies of Israel (1 Samuel 15:8).
- The Amalekites were the first nation to attack Israel after their exodus from Egypt (Exodus 17:8-16).
- God commanded Israel to remember the Amalekites’ actions and to blot out their memory (Deuteronomy 25:17-19).
- King Saul failed to fully execute God’s judgment against them, leading to the continued enmity seen in Esther (1 Samuel 15:9-11).

## Summary of Chapter 3
- Haman is elevated to a position of power, and the king commands that people bow to him (Esther 3:2).
- Mordecai refuses to bow, citing his Jewish identity and history with the Amalekites (Esther 3:4-5).
- Haman, enraged, plots not just to kill Mordecai but to exterminate all Jews in the Persian Empire (Esther 3:6).
- He casts lots (Purim) to determine the day for the massacre, landing on the twelfth month (Esther 3:7).
- Haman convinces King Xerxes to issue an edict for the genocide of the Jews (Esther 3:8-11).
- The decree is sent throughout the empire, throwing the city of Susa into confusion (Esther 3:15).

## Key Themes & Lessons
1. **Spiritual Warfare and Historical Enmity**
   - The conflict between Haman and Mordecai is more than personal; it reflects an ancient spiritual battle (Ephesians 6:12).
   - The Amalekites symbolize opposition to God's people, stretching from Exodus through Esther.
   - Satan actively seeks to thwart God's redemptive plan, using human opposition as a tool (John 10:10).

2. **Courage in the Face of Persecution**
   - Mordecai stands firm in his faith, refusing to compromise even under threat of death (Daniel 3:16-18).
   - This challenges believers to remain steadfast in their convictions despite cultural or political pressures (Acts 5:29).

3. **The Role of God's Providence**
   - Though God’s name is absent in Esther, His hand is evident in orchestrating events (Romans 8:28, Proverbs 21:1).
   - The seemingly random casting of lots (Purim) aligns with God's divine timing (Proverbs 16:33).
   - The Jewish people appear vulnerable, yet God's unseen presence ensures their survival.

4. **The Dangers of Power and Pride**
   - Haman’s unchecked pride leads to an irrational hatred and desire for destruction (Proverbs 16:18).
   - His actions illustrate the consequences of power without moral restraint.
   - The contrast between Haman and Mordecai highlights the difference between pride and humility (James 4:6).

## Connection to Modern Life
- Spiritual battles continue today; believers must be aware of opposition to God's purposes (1 Peter 5:8-9).
- Standing for faith may bring trials, but God's providence ensures ultimate victory (2 Corinthians 4:8-9).
- The rise and fall of leaders demonstrate the importance of humility and righteous leadership (Proverbs 29:2).
- The story of Esther reminds us to trust God even when He seems silent in our circumstances (Isaiah 41:10).

## Looking Ahead
- The Jewish community faces imminent destruction, leading Mordecai and Esther to take bold action.
- Chapter 4 will reveal Esther’s response and the call to courage in the face of adversity (Esther 4:14).
